This is within the human's desired speed range of 5-7 m/s.\nThe car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is [0, 0, 0, 0], indicating it's perfectly aligned with the racing line. This suggests the car is not experiencing any significant oscillations.\nThe distance to the left and right walls is [1, 1, 1, 1], which is constant, indicating the car is not approaching or receding from the walls.\nSince the car is not reversing, not crashed, and not facing the wall, and its speed is within the human's desired range, I can conclude:\nExplanation: The car's speed is within the human's desired range and it's not experiencing any issues that would require an adjustment.\nAdhering to Human: True", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 487, "rag_tokens": 131, "output_tokens": 222, "model_name": "local_llama-3"}
