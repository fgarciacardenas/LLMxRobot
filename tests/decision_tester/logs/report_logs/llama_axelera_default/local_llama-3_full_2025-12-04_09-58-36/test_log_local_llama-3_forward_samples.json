This indicates that the car is indeed oscillating around the racing line.\nThe d-speed values also show oscillations, but they are not as pronounced as the d-coordinate values. However, the magnitude of the oscillations in d-speed is generally less than 0.5 m/s, which is consistent with the car being on a minimal curvature trajectory.\nSince the car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is within the range of 5-7 m/s, we can assume that the car is moving in a generally forward direction.\nThe distances to the left and right walls are relatively close, indicating that the car is on the centerline.\nTherefore, the car is oscillating.\nAdhering to Human: True", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 706, "rag_tokens": 131, "output_tokens": 203, "model_name": "local_llama-3"}

We can see that the d-coordinate values are mostly positive, which means the car is generally following the racing line.\nHowever, there are some oscillations in the d-coordinate values, with a larger magnitude of 0.2m at points 3 and 4. This suggests that the car is not perfectly on the racing line, but it's not oscillating wildly.\nThe distance to the left wall is [1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5], and the distance to the right wall is [1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.4]. The values are generally consistent, with the left distance being slightly larger than the right distance, indicating the car is slightly off-center.\nConsidering the s-coordinate and d-coordinate values, the car is generally following the racing line, but not perfectly. Therefore, the car is not strictly adhering to the human's instruction to drive on the racing line.

However, the d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, with larger magnitude than 0.3 meters, indicating that the car is oscillating around the racing line. This suggests that the car is not strictly following the racing line.\nThe car's speed along the racing line is generally consistent, ranging from 6 to 6.8 meters per second, which is suitable for driving on the racing line. The speed perpendicular to the racing line is also relatively consistent, with values ranging from 0.04 to 0.1 meters per second, indicating that the car is not drifting significantly off the line.\nThe distance to the left and right walls is mostly within 0.1 meters, with some variation, but not consistently close to the walls. This suggests that the car is not currently close to the walls.\nBased on the analysis, the car is not strictly driving on the racing line.\nAdhering to Human: False", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": false, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 712, "rag_tokens": 142, "output_tokens": 246, "model_name": "local_llama-3"}
