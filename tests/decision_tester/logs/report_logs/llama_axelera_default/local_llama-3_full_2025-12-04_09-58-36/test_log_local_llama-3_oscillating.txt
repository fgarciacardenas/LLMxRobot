Model Response: I'm currently running on the Metis AI chip, and I have the data available.
Since the car is not moving (s-speed = 0m/s), I should be maintaining a consistent position along the racing line. However, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is oscillating, with values ranging from -0.4 to 0.6m. This suggests that I am not strictly adhering to the racing line.
Given the distances to the left and right walls are within 0.4m, I should be maintaining a safe distance from the walls. The car's position along the racing line is [10, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, 87], which indicates that I am not currently close to the walls.

Model Response: I'm currently running on the Metis chip, and I have the data.
Since the car is not moving (s-speed = 0m/s), I don't need to adjust my trajectory. The car is not crashing (no crash data), and I'm not facing the wall (d-coordinate < 0.3m). The car is not reversing (no reversal data). The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory, so I should maintain a consistent distance from the wall. The distances to the left and right walls are both > 0.4m, so I'm not at risk of hitting either wall. Therefore, I am not deviating from the racing line.

Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.

Model Response: To determine if the car should reverse, I will analyze the data.
The car's s-speed is not consistently negative, so it's not reversing (Hint 5). The s-speed is also not consistently close to 0m/s, so the car is not stopped (Hint 4). The s-speed is generally between 5 and 7m/s, so the car is driving forward (Hint 2).
The d-coordinate is oscillating from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 meters, indicating the car is oscillating around the racing line (Hint 7). This suggests the car is not adhering to the racing line.
Therefore, the car should reverse to correct its trajectory and stay on the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: I'm currently driving the car on the track, and I have the data.
Explanation: The car's s-speed is 6m/s, which is within the range of 5-7m/s, so it's likely the car is moving forward. The s-coordinate is increasing, indicating the car is moving along the racing line. The d-coordinate is oscillating with a magnitude of up to 0.3m, which is not a strong indication of a deviation from the racing line. The distance to the left and right walls is within a reasonable range, and the car is not facing the wall. The s-speed is not negative, so the car is not reversing. The car has not crashed. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's goal of driving on the racing line. Adhering to Human: True

Model Response: To determine if the car should reverse, I will analyze the data.
The car's s-speed is not consistently reducing, so it's likely not reversing (Hint 5). The s-speed is also not close to 0m/s, so the car is not stopped (Hint 4). The car's speed is within the desired range of 5-7m/s, so it's not being driven too slowly (Hint 2).
However, the d-coordinate is oscillating from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 meters, indicating that the car is deviating from the racing line (Hint 7). This suggests that the car is not adhering to the desired racing line.
Therefore, the car should reverse to correct its position and stay on the racing line.

The car's s-coordinate is increasing over the 2 seconds, indicating it's moving along the racing line. The s-speed is constant at 6m/s, which is within the desired range. The d-coordinate is oscillating, but the magnitudes are relatively small (0.4-0.7m), indicating the car is still on the racing line. The distance to the left and right walls is also increasing, indicating the car is moving forward.
Since the car is moving along the racing line, adhering to the human's desired path, and the s-speed is within the desired range, there is no indication that the car should reverse.

Model Response: I am currently analyzing the data to determine if the car should reverse.
The car's s-speed is [6, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 6], which is generally within the desired range of 5-7m/s. The s-coordinate is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], indicating the car is moving along the racing line. The d-coordinate is [0.1, -0.2, 0.3, -0.4, 0.2, -0.1, 0.4, -0.3, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1], which is oscillating around the racing line with a magnitude of up to 0.4 meters, but not excessively so. The car is not stopping (s-speed is not close to 0m/s) and is not reversing (s-speed is not negative). The car is not facing the wall (d-coordinate is not consistently negative). Therefore, the car is not adhering to the instruction to reverse.

Model Response: To determine if the car should reverse, I'll analyze the data.
The car's s-speed is not consistently negative, so it's not currently reversing (Hint 5). The s-speed is mostly between 6 and 7m/s, which is within the desired range (Hint 2). The s-coordinate is increasing, indicating the car is moving forward along the racing line.
However, the d-coordinate is oscillating with larger magnitude than 0.3 meters at multiple points, indicating the car is not perfectly adhering to the racing line (Hint 7). This suggests the car is not driving smoothly and may be at risk of losing control.
Therefore, the car should not be reversing, but it's not strictly adhering to the desired path.

Model Response: Since the car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Coordinate frame, and the car is not crashing or reversing, I will proceed to analyze the data.
The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is 6m/s, which is within the desired range of 5-7m/s. The lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is oscillating from -0.4 to 0.6m, which is not strictly adhering to the desired range of -0.3m. However, the magnitude of the oscillation is not extremely large, so I will not immediately take action.
The distance to the left wall is 1.2m, which is greater than 0.4m, indicating that the car is not currently close to the wall. The distance to the right wall is 1.3m, which is also greater

Model Response: Since the car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Coordinate frame, and the car is not crashing or reversing, I will proceed to analyze the data.
The car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is increasing, indicating that the car is moving forward. The lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is oscillating, but the magnitude is not too large (less than 0.6m), so the car is not too far off the optimal path. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is constant at 6m/s, which is within the desired range. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also within the desired range.
However, the distance to the left wall (0.8m) and the distance to the right wall (0.9m) are both relatively close, indicating that the car is not maintaining a consistent distance from the walls. To maintain a safe distance, I should aim to reduce the lateral deviation and keep the car centered on the racing line.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: I'm ready to drive. Since the car is currently on the track, I will assume it's moving forward unless instructed otherwise.
To determine the current average speed, I'll calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the time elapsed.
Total distance traveled = 40 - 10 = 30 meters
Time elapsed = 2 seconds
Average speed = 30 meters / 2 seconds = 15 meters per second
The human's desired speed is between 5 and 7 meters per second. Since my current speed (15 meters per second) is outside of this range, I will adjust my speed to match the human's preference.
To maintain a safe distance from the wall, I'll keep an eye on the distance to the left and right walls. The distance to the left wall is 0.3 meters, which is within the acceptable range. The distance to the right wall is 0.4 meters, which is also within the acceptable range.
The d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 meters, indicating that I'm oscillating around the racing line. To correct this, I'll adjust my steering to maintain a consistent distance from the center of the racing line.
I will drive forward, maintaining an average speed of 6 meters per second, and adjust my steering to stay on the racing line.

Model Response: To determine if the car should oscillate, I need to analyze the data. The d-coordinate oscillates from 0.4m to -0.9m, which is a significant deviation from the racing line. The magnitude of the oscillation is larger than 0.3m. Since the car is not crashing (no crash data provided) and is not reversing (not facing the wall), I will consider the car's oscillation around the racing line. The car's speed is within the normal range (5.5-6.5 m/s), so it is likely the human wants the car to continue on the racing line. However, the oscillation suggests that the car is not perfectly centered. Therefore, I will recommend oscillating to try to center the car.

Model Response: To determine if the car is oscillating, we need to analyze the d-coordinate and d-speed data.
The d-coordinate oscillates from -0.4 to 0.6 meters, which is a range of 1 meter. This oscillation is not negligible, as per Hint 8.
However, the magnitude of the oscillation (1 meter) is not as large as the distance to the wall (1.4-1.6 meters), which suggests that the car is not severely deviating from the racing line.
The d-speed values oscillate between 0.5-0.8 meters per second, which is within the range of 0.5-1 meter per second, as per Hint 2. This indicates that the car is still moving in a relatively straight line.
Since the car is not crashing (Hint 10: False) and is not reversing (Hint 6: False), it is likely that the car is still following the racing line.

Model Response: To determine if the car should oscillate, we need to analyze the d-coordinate and d-speed values.

The d-speed values are: [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6]
We can see that the d-coordinate values are oscillating, but the magnitude of the oscillations are not extreme (less than 0.3m). The d-speed values are generally consistent with the car moving along the racing line.
However, the d-coordinate values are not strictly oscillating around the racing line, as they are not oscillating from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3m.
Therefore, the car is not strictly oscillating around the racing line.

Model Response: To determine if the car should oscillate, I'll analyze the data.
The car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is increasing, indicating it's moving forward. The d-coordinate oscillates from 0.5 to -0.4 meters, which is within the negligible range. The d-speed is also increasing, indicating the car is accelerating. The left and right distances to the walls are relatively close, suggesting the car is centered on the racing line. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is between 5 and 7 meters per second, which is within the expected range.
However, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is oscillating, which could be a sign of instability. The magnitude of the oscillations is within the negligible range, but the fact that it's oscillating at all suggests the car is not perfectly centered on the racing line.
Given the data, I will recommend oscillating to maintain stability and optimize the lap time.

Model Response: To determine if the car is oscillating, I'll analyze the data.
The d-coordinate oscillates from 0.1 to -0.3m and then to 0.3m, indicating a deviation from the racing line. However, the magnitude of the oscillation is not large enough to be considered significant (Hint 8). The d-speed also shows oscillations, but they are within the range of 0.6 to 0.8 m/s, which is consistent with the car's speed (Hint 2). The left and right distances to the walls are relatively equal, indicating the car is on the centerline (Hint 10). The car is not reversing (Hint 4) and is not facing the wall (Hint 7). The car's speed is within the desired range of 5 to 7 m/s.

The car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is within the range of 10 to 16.5 meters, which is suitable for the racing line. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is mostly between 5.5 and 6.2 meters per second, which is within the expected range. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is oscillating, but the magnitude of the oscillations is within the negligible range of -0.3 to 0.3 meters.
However, the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is mostly between 0.6 and 0.7 meters per second, which is not within the expected range of 0 to 0.5 meters per second. This indicates that the car is not perfectly aligned with the racing line.

Model Response: To determine if the car is oscillating, we need to check the d-coordinate and d-speed.
The d-coordinate oscillates from 0.2m to -0.5m, which is a change of 0.7m. This is greater than the negligible threshold of 0.3m.
The d-speed oscillates from 0.6m/s to -0.8m/s, which is a change of 1.4m/s. This is also greater than the negligible threshold of 0.5m/s.
Since both the d-coordinate and d-speed are oscillating, the car is not strictly on the racing line. However, we need to check if the car is adhering to the human's command: Oscillate!.
The car's position along the racing line is [0, 1.8, 3.5, 5.4, 7.2], which suggests that the car is not strictly on the racing line, but the oscillations are not extreme.
Therefore, the car is not strictly adhering to the human's command: Oscillate!.

The distance to the left wall is: [0.6, 0.5, 0.7, 0.4, 0.8, 0.9]
The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is: [0.4, -0.5, 0.6, -0.7, 0.8, -0.9]
Since the car is not crashing (Hint 5: Not provided, but we can assume it's not crashing since the car is not crashing), we can ignore the distance to the left wall for now. However, we need to check if the car is close to the wall.
The distance to the left wall is less than 0.4m in 4 out of 6 samples (Hint 3: If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall). This indicates that the car is indeed close to the left wall in some parts of the track.
The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is also close to the wall in some parts, but not consistently (Hint 6: A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line). This suggests that the car is not strictly adhering to the racing line.

Model Response: To determine if the car should drive close to the left wall, we need to check the distance to the left wall and the car's lateral deviation from the racing line.
The distance to the left wall is: [1.3, 1.3, 1.6, 1.2, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5]
The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is: [0.1, -0.2, 0.3, -0.3, 0.2, -0.1, 0.1]
Since the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is not consistently close to 0, the car is not strictly on the racing line. However, the distance to the left wall is less than 0.4m in 5 out of 7 samples, indicating that the car is generally close to the left wall.

The car's speed along the racing line is s-speed = 6.5 m/s, which is not close to 0 m/s, indicating the car is moving.
Since the car is not close to the left wall, I will adjust the steering to bring the car closer to the wall. I will also check the distance to the right wall, which is 1.6 meters, to ensure the car is not drifting too far to the right.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car should drive close to the left wall, I will analyze the data.
The car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is increasing, indicating it's moving forward. The s-speed is also increasing, confirming the car is moving. The distance to the left wall is 0.6m, which is below the threshold of 0.4m. The distance to the right wall is 0.7m, which is above the threshold of 0.4m.
Since the car is close to the left wall and moving forward, it should continue to drive close to the left wall. The d-coordinate is -0.2m, indicating the car is slightly off-center to the left, but still within the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car should drive close to the left wall, we need to check the distance to the left wall and the car's lateral deviation from the racing line.
The distance to the left wall is 0.6m, which is greater than 0.4m. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is 0.4m, which is within the acceptable range of 0.3m to 0.5m.
Since the car is not on the wall and not crashing, and the distance to the left wall is not minimal, the car is not strictly adhering to the human's request to drive close to the left wall.

The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Since the car is not oscillating around the racing line (d-coordinates are not oscillating from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3m), it's likely on the centerline.
The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, -0.2, 0.3, -0.4, 0.2, -0.1, 0.4, -0.3, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1]. The d-coordinates are not consistently above 0.3m, indicating the car is not significantly deviating from the centerline.

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Model Response: To determine if the car is on the centerline, I'll analyze the data.
The car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is given, but to check if it's on the centerline, I need to look at the lateral deviation (d-coordinate).
In the given data, the d-coordinates are: [0.2, -0.3, 0.4, -0.5, 0.3, -0.4, 0.5, -0.3].
Since the d-coordinates oscillate from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 meters, the car is oscillating around the racing line. This indicates that the car is not strictly on the centerline.
However, the car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is constant at 6 meters per second, which suggests that the car is moving in a straight line.
Given the oscillation in the d-coordinates and the constant s-speed, I will assume the car is trying to correct its trajectory to stay on the racing line.

Model Response: To determine if the car is driving faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed along the racing line.
The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 5.5]
To calculate the average speed, we sum the s-speed values and divide by the number of samples:
Average s-speed = (6 + 6.5 + 5.5 + 6 + 6.5 + 5.5) / 6
Average s-speed = 36 / 6
Average s-speed = 6
The average s-speed is 6 m/s, which is less than 3 m/s. Therefore, the car is not driving faster than 3 m/s.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car should drive faster than 3 m/s, I will analyze the data.
The car's current speed along the racing line (s-speed) is 6 m/s, which is above the desired speed of 3 m/s. However, the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is 0.6 m/s, which is not high.
Since the car is not stopped (s-speed is not close to 0 m/s) and the d-speed is not extremely high (above 0.5 m/s), I will not consider the car to be in a situation where it needs to accelerate to a higher speed.
Therefore, the car is not strictly adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s.

The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 7, 6.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 6.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 6.5, 6, 6.5]
To calculate the average speed, we can use the formula: average speed = (sum of all speeds) / number of samples
The sum of the s-speed values is: 6 + 6.5 + 7 + 6.5 + 6 + 6.5 + 7 + 6.5 + 6 +

Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.

Model Response: I can provide a response as the AI on the Metis chip.
To determine if the car is driving faster than 3 m/s, I will calculate the average speed of the car along the racing line.
The car's s-speed values are: [6, 6.5, 7, 6.8, 6.2, 6.5, 7, 6.6, 6.3, 6.4]
Average s-speed: (6 + 6.5 + 7 + 6.8 + 6.2 + 6.5 + 7 + 6.6 + 6.3 + 6.4) / 10 = 6.5 m/s
Since the average s-speed (6.5 m/s) is greater than 3 m/s, the car is currently driving faster than the human's desired speed.

Model Response: To determine the car's current position on the racing line, I'll analyze the given data.
The car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35], which indicates the car is currently at a position on the track. The lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is [0.4, -0.5, 0.6, -0.7, 0.8, -0.9].
Since the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3m, the car is oscillating around the racing line. This suggests that the car is not strictly on the racing line.
The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is [6, 6.5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 5.5], which is relatively consistent, indicating the car is moving in a straight line. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is [0.6, -0.7, 0.8, -0.9, 1.0, -1.1], which is also oscillating, but with smaller magnitude than the d-coordinate, indicating the car is not deviating significantly from the racing line in the direction perpendicular to it.
The distance to the left wall is [0.6, 0.5, 0.7, 0.4, 0.8, 0.9], and the distance to the right wall is [1.2, 1.3, 1.1, 1.4, 1.0, 0.9]. The car is not close to either wall, as the distances are greater than 0.4m.

The car's position along the racing line is: [10, 15, 20]

Model Response: To determine if the car is driving on the racing line, we need to analyze the s-coordinate and d-coordinate values.
The s-coordinate represents the car's position along the racing line, and it ranges from 0 to 12. The d-coordinate represents the car's lateral deviation from the racing line, and it ranges from -1.6 to 1.6.
We can see that the s-coordinate values are increasing from 0 to 12, indicating that the car is moving along the racing line. However, the d-coordinate values are oscillating between positive and negative values, with some values above 0.3m, which suggests that the car is not strictly following the racing line.
To confirm, we can check if the car is close to the wall by looking at the distance to the left and right walls. The distance to the left wall is 1.3m, and the distance to the right wall is 1.4m, which are close to each

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car is driving on the racing line, I'll analyze the data.
The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 21, 27, 34] meters. The racing line is considered to be within the bounds of the s-coordinate if the car's position is close to the centerline, which is roughly the case here. The d-coordinate indicates the car's lateral deviation from the racing line: [0.4, -0.5, 0.6, -0.7, 0.5].
Since the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 meters, the car is oscillating around the racing line. This suggests that the car is not strictly driving on the racing line.
However, the car's speed along the racing line is given as 6 meters per second, which is constant. This indicates that the car is moving in the direction of the racing line.
Considering the above points, I will not strictly adhere to the racing line.

Model Response: To determine if the car is driving on the racing line, I'll analyze the data.
The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate, which ranges from 0 to 8. The car's speed along the racing line is constant at 6 m/s. The distance to the left and right walls is also provided.
Since the car's speed along the racing line is constant, it's likely that the car is following a straight section of the racing line. However, the lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate, which oscillates between positive and negative values.
To determine if the car is driving on the racing line, I'll check if the magnitude of the d-coordinate is less than 0.3m.
Explanation: The car's d-coordinates are: [0.4, -0.4, 0.5, -0.5, 0.6, -0.6, 0.7, -0.7, 0.8]. The maximum magnitude of the d-coordinates is 0.8m, which is greater than 0.3m. However, the car is not strictly following the racing line as it oscillates.

Since the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3m, the car is oscillating around the racing line.
The car is not strictly on the racing line, as the d-coordinate values are not consistently above 0.3m. However, the car is not crashing, as the distance to the walls is not extremely close (Hint 3). The car is not reversing, and it is not facing the wall (Hint 7).

Model Response: To determine if the car is driving on the racing line, we need to analyze the s-coordinate and d-coordinate.
The s-coordinate indicates the car's position along the racing line, and the d-coordinate indicates the car's lateral deviation from the racing line.
In the given data, the s-coordinate is mostly within the range of 1.3 to 1.7 meters, which is within the racing line. However, the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 meters, indicating that the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Therefore, the car is not strictly adhering to the racing line, as it is deviating from it.

The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.7, -0.7, 0.8, -0.8, 0.9, -0.9]. The magnitude of the d-speed oscillates, indicating the car is not maintaining a consistent distance from the racing line.
The distance to the left wall is: [1, 1.5, 1, 1.5, 1, 1.5], and the distance to the right wall is: [1.5, 1, 1.5, 1, 1.5, 1]. The distances to the walls are not consistently equal, indicating the car is not centered on the racing line.
Based on the analysis, the car is not strictly adhering to the racing line.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Model Response: To determine if the car is on the racing line, I'll analyze the s-coordinate and d-coordinate data.
The s-coordinate indicates the car's position along the racing line, and it's given as [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]. This suggests the car is moving forward in a straight line.
The d-coordinate represents the car's lateral deviation from the racing line, and it's given as [0.2, -0.3, 0.4, -0.5, 0.3, -0.4, 0.5, -0.3].
Since the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3m, the car is oscillating around the racing line. This indicates the car is not strictly on the racing line.
However, the magnitude of the d-coordinate is generally small, with most values between -0.3m and 0.3m. This suggests the car is mostly following the racing line, but not perfectly.
Therefore, the car is not strictly on the racing line, but it's generally adhering to the human's instruction to drive on the racing line.
