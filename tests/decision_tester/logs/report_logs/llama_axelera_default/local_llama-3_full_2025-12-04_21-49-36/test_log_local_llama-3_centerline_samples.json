If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 meters, then the car is oscillating around the racing line. We have the following d-coordinate values: [0, 0, 0, 0]. Since all values are 0, the car is not oscillating around the racing line. Additionally, the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is [0, 0, 0, 0], which is not oscillating. The car is not reversing, as indicated by the absence of negative s-speed values and no reduction in s-coordinate over multiple samples. The car is not facing the wall, as indicated by the distance to the left and right walls being constant. The car is not crashing, as indicated by the absence of crash detection.
