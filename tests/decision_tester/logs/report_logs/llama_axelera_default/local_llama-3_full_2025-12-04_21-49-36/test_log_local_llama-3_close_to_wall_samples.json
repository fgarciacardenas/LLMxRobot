The car is not crashing (d-coordinate is not oscillating wildly or showing a significant deviation from the racing line).\nHowever, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is [0.35, 0.35, 0.36, 0.36], which is oscillating from positive to negative values with a magnitude of 0.01 meters, which is less than the threshold of 0.3 meters.
