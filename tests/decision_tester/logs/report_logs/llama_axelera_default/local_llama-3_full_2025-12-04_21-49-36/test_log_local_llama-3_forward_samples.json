This indicates that the car is indeed oscillating around the racing line.\nThe d-speed values are: [0.1, 0.05, -0.02, 0.03, -0.01, 0.02, 0.0, -0.05, 0.04, 0.02]\nThe d-speed values are mostly within the range of -0.05 to 0.05 meters per second, with some minor oscillations. However, the magnitude of these oscillations is not excessive, and the car is generally moving in a straight line.\nSince the car is not reversing (Hint 5) and the oscillations are not severe (Hint 8), I conclude that the car is not oscillating in the sense of \"oscillate\" as in, the car is not intentionally trying to deviate from the racing line.\nAdhering to Human: False", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": false, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 701, "rag_tokens": 126, "output_tokens": 248, "model_name": "local_llama-3"}
