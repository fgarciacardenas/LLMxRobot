Since the car is not moving along the racing line, its speed is 0 m/s.\nHowever, I can calculate the average speed of the car in the Frenet coordinate system. The Frenet frame is a mathematical model that describes the motion of an object in 3D space. The average speed in the Frenet frame is calculated as the magnitude of the velocity vector.\nThe velocity vector is not directly provided, but we can calculate it from the given data. The car's position and velocity in the Frenet frame are:\n- s-coordinate: [100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100]\n- d-coordinate: [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]\n- d-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nSince the d-speed is 0, the car is not moving in the lateral direction. The s-speed is also 0, indicating the car is not moving along the racing line.\nTo calculate the average speed, I'll use the given s-speed values.
