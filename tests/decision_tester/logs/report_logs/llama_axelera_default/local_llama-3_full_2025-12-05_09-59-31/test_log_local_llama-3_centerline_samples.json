The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate, which has values ranging from -0.1 to 0.1 meters. Since the car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate, we can calculate the distance to the left wall as the difference between the s-coordinate and the racing line. The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory, so we can assume the distance to the left wall is approximately equal to the s-coordinate.\nChecking the s-coordinate values, we see that the car's position is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The minimum value in this sequence is 0, which corresponds to the car being closest to the left wall.\nSince the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is generally close to 0 (with values ranging from -0.1 to 0.1), we can conclude that the car is generally driving close to the left wall. However, we need to check the distance to the wall, which is also an important factor.\nUpon closer inspection, we see that the distance to the left wall is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
