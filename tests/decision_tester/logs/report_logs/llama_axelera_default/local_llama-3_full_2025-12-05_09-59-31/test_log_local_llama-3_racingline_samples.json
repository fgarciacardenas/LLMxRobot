The ideal s-coordinate is the average of the first and last values: (20 + 55) / 2 = 37.5.\nNow, let's calculate the average deviation from the ideal racing line:\nAverage deviation = |s - 37.5| = |20 - 37.5| + |25 - 37.5| + |30 - 37.5| + |35 - 37.5| + |40 - 37.5| + |45 - 37.5| + |50 - 37.5| + |55 - 37.5|\n= 17.5 + 12.5 + 7.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 7.5 + 12.5 + 17.5\n= 60\nThe average deviation is 7.5 meters.
