The ideal racing line is a straight line, so we can consider the car's position as being on the line if the s-coordinate is within a small range around the center of the track.\nGiven the s-coordinate values: [50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39], we can see that the car is not perfectly on the line, as the values are decreasing. However, we can calculate the average s-coordinate to get a better estimate of the car's position on the line.\nAverage s-coordinate: (50 + 49 + 48 + 47 + 46 + 45 + 44 + 43 + 42 + 41 + 40 + 39) / 12 = 48.5\nWe can consider the car to be on the racing line if the s-coordinate is within 1 meter of the average (48.5).\nChecking the s-coordinate values:\n- 50 is 1.5 meters away from 48.5\n- 49 is 1.5 meters away from 48.5\n- 48 is 0.5 meters away from 48.5\n- 47 is 1.5 meters away from 48.5\n- 46 is 2.5 meters away from 48.5\n- 45 is 3.5 meters away from 48.5\n- 44 is 4.5 meters away from 48.5\n- 43 is 5.5 meters away from 48.5\n- 42 is 6.5 meters away from 48.", "structure_followed": false, "sanitized_output": null, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 591, "rag_tokens": 1, "output_tokens": 386, "model_name": "local_llama-3"}
