        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 10 samples.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The human wants the car to drive forward, and the car is currently on the track, which implies it is moving in the forward direction. However, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is oscillating, indicating it is not perfectly following the racing line. The car's speed along the racing line is constant, suggesting it is maintaining a steady pace.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The average speed can be calculated using the formula: average speed = (sum of s-speed values) / number of samples.

Sum of s-speed values = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 72

Number of samples = 13

Average speed = 72 / 13 ≈ 5.54 m/s

Since the average speed is approximately 5.54 m/s, which is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

Explanation: The car's average speed is less than the human's desired speed of 3 m/s.

If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The average speed can be calculated using the formula: average speed = (sum of s-speed values) / number of samples.

Sum of s-speed values = 5.5 + 5.5 + 5.6 + 5.6 + 5.7 + 5.7 + 5.6 + 5.6 + 5.5 + 5.5 + 5.6 + 5.6 = 65.5

Number of samples = 12

Average speed = 65.5 / 12 = 5.4583 m/s

Since the average speed is approximately 5.46 m/s, which is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

Explanation: The car's average speed is less than the human's desired speed of 3 m/s.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The average speed can be calculated using the formula: average speed = (sum of s-speed values) / number of samples.

Given s-speed values: [6, 6.5, 6.7, 6.5, 6.2]

Average s-speed = (6 + 6.5 + 6.7 + 6.5 + 6.2) / 5 = 32.4 / 5 = 6.48 m/s

Since the average s-speed (6.48 m/s) is greater than 3 m/s, the car is currently driving faster than the human's request.

Explanation: The car's average speed is greater than 3 m/s, indicating it is driving faster than the human's request.

A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate, and its lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate. The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed, and its speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed. The distances to the left and right walls are also provided.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 3 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [5, 12, 19]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.15, 0.2]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6.5, 6.8, 7.0]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.2, 0.25, 0.3]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.35, 0.3, 0.25]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [2.0, 2.1, 2.2]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False

The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed, and its speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed. The distance to the left wall and the right wall are also provided. However, the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is not strictly zero, indicating that the car is not perfectly on the racing line.
