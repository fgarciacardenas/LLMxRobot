        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.

        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The average speed can be calculated using the formula: average speed = (s-speed1 + s-speed2 + s-speed3) / 3

Given the s-speed values: [6, 6.5, 7]

average speed = (6 + 6.5 + 7) / 3 = 19.5 / 3 = 6.5 m/s

Since the average speed (6.5 m/s) is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The average speed can be calculated using the formula: average speed = (sum of s-speed values) / number of samples.

Sum of s-speed values = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 70

Number of samples = 14

Average speed = 70 / 14 = 5 m/s

Since the average speed is 5 m/s, which is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 7]. To calculate the average speed, we can use the formula:

Average speed = (s-speed1 + s-speed2 + s-speed3) / 3

Plugging in the values, we get:

Average speed = (6 + 6.5 + 7) / 3
= 19.5 / 3
= 6.5 m/s

Since the average speed (6.5 m/s) is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The average speed can be calculated using the formula: average speed = (sum of s-speed values) / number of samples.

Sum of s-speed values = 5.5 + 5.8 + 6.0 + 6.2 + 6.5 + 6.7 + 6.8 + 6.9 + 7.0 + 6.8 + 6.7 + 6.5 + 6.3 = 72.2

Number of samples = 13

Average speed = 72.2 / 13 = 5.57 m/s

Since the average speed (5.57 m/s) is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

Explanation: The car's average speed is less than the desired speed of 3 m/s.

The average speed can be calculated using the formula: average speed = (sum of s-speeds) / number of samples.

Given the s-speed values: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], the sum of s-speeds is 6 * 5 = 30 m/s.

The number of samples is 5.

Therefore, the average speed is 30 m/s / 5 = 6 m/s.

Since the average speed (6 m/s) is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate, and its lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate. The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed, and its speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed. The distance to the left and right walls is also provided. However, the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is very small, indicating that the car is moving along the racing line.

Adhering to Human: False

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 4 seconds in 10 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 0.7, 1.4, 2.1, 2.8, 3.5, 4.2, 4.9, 5.6, 6.3]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.05, 0.02, -0.01, 0.03, -0.02, 0.01, 0.04, -0.03, 0.01, 0]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 6.8, 7, 6.9, 6.7, 6.5, 6.3, 6.1, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.05, 0.07, 0.02, 0.03, 0.08, 0.05, 0.06, 0.04, 0.03]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.5, 1.4, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.5]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.3, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.4]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False
