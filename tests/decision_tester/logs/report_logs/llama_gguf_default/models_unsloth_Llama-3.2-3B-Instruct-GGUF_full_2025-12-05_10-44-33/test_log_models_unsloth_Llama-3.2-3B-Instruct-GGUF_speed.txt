        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.05, -0.1, 0.1, -0.05]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5, 6, 6, 7, 7]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The human wants the car to drive forward, and the car is currently on the track, which implies it is moving in the forward direction. However, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is oscillating, indicating it is not perfectly following the racing line.

If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 7:

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The human wants the car to drive forward, and the car is currently on the track, which implies it is moving in the forward direction. However, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is oscillating, indicating it is not perfectly following the racing line. The car's speed along the racing line is within the desired range of 5 to 7 m/s, but the speed perpendicular to the racing line is not zero, suggesting the car is not moving purely forward.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 7 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.2, -0.1, 0.0, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 4]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The average speed can be calculated using the formula:

Average Speed = (Sum of s-speed values) / Number of samples

Sum of s-speed values = 4.5 + 5.0 + 5.5 + 5.0 + 4.5 + 5.0 + 5.5 + 5.0 = 40.0

Number of samples = 8

Average Speed = 40.0 / 8 = 5.0 m/s

Since the average speed (5.0 m/s) is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5]

First, we calculate the average speed:

Average speed = (3.5 + 4.0 + 4.5 + 5.0 + 5.5 + 6.0 + 6.5) / 7
= 34.0 / 7
= 4.86 m/s

Since the average speed (4.86 m/s) is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The average speed can be calculated using the formula: average speed = (sum of s-speed values) / number of samples.

Sum of s-speed values = 5 + 5.5 + 5.2 + 5.7 + 6 + 5.8 + 6.2 + 5.5 + 5.9 + 6.1 + 5.3 + 5.6 = 65.6

Number of samples = 12

Average speed = 65.6 / 12 = 5.47 m/s

Since the average speed (5.47 m/s) is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

Explanation: The car's average speed is less than the human's desired speed of 3 m/s.

Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5, 5.5, 6]. To calculate the average speed, we can use the formula:

Average Speed = (s-speed1 + s-speed2 + s-speed3) / 3

Plugging in the values, we get:

Average Speed = (5 + 5.5 + 6) / 3
= 16.5 / 3
= 5.5 m/s

Since the average speed (5.5 m/s) is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s.

Explanation: The car's average speed is less than the human's desired speed of 3 m/s.

Since the average speed (5.29 m/s) is greater than 3 m/s, the car is adhering to the human's request.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The average speed can be calculated using the formula: average speed = (sum of s-speed values) / number of samples.

Sum of s-speed values = 5.5 + 5.6 + 5.7 + 5.6 + 5.5 + 5.4 + 5.5 + 5.6 + 5.7 + 5.6 + 5.5 + 5.4 = 65.4

Number of samples = 12

Average speed = 65.4 / 12 = 5.45 m/s

Since the average speed (5.45 m/s) is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

Explanation: The car's average speed is less than the human's desired speed of 3 m/s.

Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car.

The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5, 5.2, 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.2, 5.1]. We can calculate the average speed as follows:

Average speed = (sum of s-speed values) / number of samples
= (5 + 5.2 + 5.1 + 5.3 + 5.4 + 5.2 + 5.1) / 7
= 35.4 / 7
= 5.05 m/s

Since the average speed (5.05 m/s) is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

Explanation: The car's average speed is less than 3 m/s, so it is not driving faster than the human wants.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
