        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 14 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5]

        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the current average speed and compare it to the desired speed.

First, let's calculate the average speed. We can do this by summing up the s-speed values and dividing by the number of samples (14).

Average s-speed = (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 14
Average s-speed = 70 / 14
Average s-speed ≈ 5.00 m/s

Since the average s-speed is 5.00 m/s, which is less than 3 m/s, the car is not currently driving faster than 3 m/s.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the current average speed.

First, we calculate the average speed along the racing line:
Average s-speed = (6 + 6.5 + 6 + 5.5 + 6 + 6 + 6.5 + 6) / 8 = 6.0625 m/s

Since the average s-speed is 6.0625 m/s, which is greater than 3 m/s, the car is currently driving faster than the human's request.

Explanation: The car's average speed along the racing line is greater than 3 m/s, indicating that it is driving faster than the human's request.

Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the current average speed of the car.

The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is given as [6, 6, 6, 6] m/s. To calculate the average speed, we can use the formula:

Average Speed = (s-speed[0] + s-speed[1] + s-speed[2] + s-speed[3]) / 4

Plugging in the values, we get:

Average Speed = (6 + 6 + 6 + 6) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6 m/s

Since the human wants the car to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to check if the average s-speed is greater than 3 m/s.

Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the current average speed of the car.

The average speed can be calculated by taking the average of the s-speed values, which are given as [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]. 

Average speed = (6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6) / 6 = 36 / 6 = 6 m/s

Since the average speed (6 m/s) is less than 3 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's request.

Explanation: The car's average speed is below the desired speed of 3 m/s.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate, which indicates the car's position on the optimal trajectory for the lap time. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate, which measures the car's distance from the ideal racing line. The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed, which is constant and within the typical speed range for racing cars.
