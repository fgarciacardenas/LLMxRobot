The distance to the left wall is: [1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2]. \n\nWe can see that the distance to the left wall is generally larger than the distance to the right wall, which means the car is not strictly on the centerline.

We can do this by taking the average of the s-speed values:\n\nAverage s-speed = (6.0 + 6.2 + 6.1 + 5.9 + 6.0 + 6.1 + 5.8 + 6.0 + 6.2 + 6.1 + 5.9 + 6.0 + 6.1) / 13\nAverage s-speed \u2248 6.08 m/s\n\nSince the human wants the car to drive faster than 3 m/s, we need to check if the average s-speed is greater than 3 m/s. However, the average s-speed is approximately 6.08 m/s, which is indeed greater than 3 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the car is adhering to the human's request.\n\nExplanation: The car's average speed is greater than 3 m/s, so it is driving faster than the human's request.\n\nAdhering to Human: True", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 787, "rag_tokens": 115, "output_tokens": 256, "model_name": "models_unsloth_Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-GGUF"}
