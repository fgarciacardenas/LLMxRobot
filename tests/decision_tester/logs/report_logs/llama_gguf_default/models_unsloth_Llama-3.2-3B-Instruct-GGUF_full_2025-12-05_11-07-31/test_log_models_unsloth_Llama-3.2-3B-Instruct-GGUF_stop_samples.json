However, the d-speed is not provided, so we will assume it is 0 m/s, as it is not specified otherwise.\n\nThe s-speed is given as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The average s-speed is 0 m/s.\n\nThe average speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the s-speed and d-speed. Since the d-speed is 0, the average speed is simply the magnitude of the s-speed, which is 0 m/s.\n\nHowever, we can calculate the average speed over the 2 seconds of data. The average s-speed is 0 m/s, and the average distance traveled is the sum of the s-coordinates, which is 10 * 13 = 130 meters. The average speed is then 130 meters / 2 seconds = 65 m/s.\n\nSince the average speed is 65 m/s, which is greater than 3 m/s, the car is adhering to the human's request.\n\nExplanation: The car's average speed was calculated to be 65 m/s, which is greater than the human's request of 3 m/s.\n\nAdhering to Human: True", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 659, "rag_tokens": 115, "output_tokens": 336, "model_name": "models_unsloth_Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-GGUF"}

The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means the car is not moving in the d-direction.\n\nHowever, we can calculate the average speed of the car by taking the magnitude of the velocity vector. Since the car is moving in a circular path, we can use the Frenet frame to calculate the velocity.\n\nThe Frenet frame has three components: tangent (T), normal (N), and binormal (B). The velocity vector can be represented as v = v_T * T + v_N * N + v_B * B.\n\nSince the car is moving in a circular path, the binormal component (v_B) is zero. The normal component (v_N) is also zero since the car is not moving perpendicular to the racing line.\n\nThe tangent component (v_T) is the speed along the racing line, which is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. However, we can calculate the magnitude of the velocity vector using the Frenet frame.\n\nThe magnitude of the velocity vector is given by ||v|| = sqrt(v_T^2 + v_N^2 + v_B^2). Since v_N and v_B are zero, the magnitude of the velocity vector is simply v_T.\n\nHowever, we need to calculate the average speed over the 2 seconds of data. We can do this by taking the average of the s-speed values.\n\nAverage s-speed = (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) / 5 = 0 m/s\n\nSince the average s-speed is 0 m/s, the car is not moving in the s-direction. However, we can calculate the average speed of the car by taking the magnitude of the velocity vector.\n\nAverage speed = sqrt((0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2) + (0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2)) = 0 m/s\n\nSince the average speed is 0 m/s, the car is not moving.
