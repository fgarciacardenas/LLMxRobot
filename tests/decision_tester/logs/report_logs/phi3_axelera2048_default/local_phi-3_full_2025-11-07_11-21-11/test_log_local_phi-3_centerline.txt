        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Reverse the car 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 6 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6]

        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.

Explancción a la instrucción 2:
The added complexity in this scenario involves more detailed data and constraints. The car's s-coordinate is not consistently decreasing, which would indicate a reversal, and the s-speed is not close to 0m/s, which would be necessary for the car to be considered stopped.
The car is not adhering to the human's request to reverse, as the s-coordinate is not showing a consistent reduction over multiple samples, and the s-speed is not close to 0m/s.
Explanation:
The s-coordinate values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] show a consistent increase, which means the car is not in the reverse position.
The s-speed values [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6] are all the same and greater than 0m/s, which means the car is not stopped.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.

Pregunta de seguimiento 1:
¿Qué debería devolverse si la respuesta a la pregunta de seguimiento 1 es que el carro no está adherido a lo que el Humano quiere?
Respuesta a la pregunta de seguimiento 1:
Si el carro no está adherido a lo que el Humano quiere, debería volver a la situación Antecedentes y Reevaluar la Instrucción para Asegurar una Comunicación Clara y Conforme con las Expectativas del Human.
Pregunta de seguimiento 2:
¿Cuál es la razón principal por la que el carro no está siguiendo las órdenes del Humano, según la respuesta de seguimiento 1?
Respuesta a la pregunta de seguimiento 2:
La Razón Principal, en este caso, podría ser un Error en la Instrucción dado que el carro no está siguiendo las órdenes del Humano, lo que indica que hay un Desajuste entre las Instrucciones Proporcionadas y la Situación Requerida.
Pregunta de seguimiento 3:
¿Qué ajustes deberían hacerse en las Instrucciones para que el carro pueda llevar a cabo la tarea como se espera?
Respuesta a la pregunta de seguimiento 3:
Para que el carro pueda llevar a cabo la tarea como se espera, deberían Ajustarse en las Instrucciones asegurándose de que se refieran a una Situación Antecedente que indica claramente y únicamente la Expectativa del Humano, sin ambigüedad ni necesidad de Aclaración adicional.
Si las Instrucciones no se pueden modificar, ¿Qué otra razón podría haber que el carro no esté siguiendo las órdenes del Humano?
Respuesta a la pregunta de seguimiento 1:
Si las Instrucciones no se pueden Modificar, otra Razón Puede Ser que el Desafío Esté en la Comprensión por Parte del Carro de las Instrucciones Complejas y que requiera de una Aclaración adicional o Instrucciones Simplificadas para Asegurar el Entendimiento y la Conformidad con lo Expedido.

Model Response: Adhering to Human: Oscillate!: True
Explanation: The car is oscillating around the racing line as indicated by the d-coordinate values changing from positive to negative and vice versa. The oscillations in the d-coordinate are within the negligible range of 0.3m. The s-speed values are all the same and non-negative, which means the car is not reversing. The d-speed values are all zero, which means the car is not crashing. The car is facing the wall, but it is moving forwards.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
