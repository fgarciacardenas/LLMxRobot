Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 8 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [-0.35, -0.36, -0.37, -0.35, -0.34, -0.36, -0.38, -0.35]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6.0, 6.2, 6.1, 6.0, 6.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.0]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.2]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.35, 0.36, 0.37, 0.35, 0.34, 0.36, 0.38, 0.35]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [2.65, 2.64, 2.63, 2.65, 2.66, 2.64, 2.62, 2.65]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!

Model Response: The car's oscillations in the d-coordinate are within the negligible range, and the d-speed is above the threshold, indicating that the car is oscillating as desired.
The car is not oscillating as desired, as the oscillations in the d-coordinate are within the negligible range, and the s-speed is not negative.
The car is oscillating with the d-coordinate showing a reduction from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, and the s-speed is above the threshold, which means the car is oscillating as the human wants.

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.

        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [-0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format:

Model Response: The car's current average speed (s-coordinate) is 6m/s, and the magnitude of oscillation (d-coordinate) is 0.3.
The car's current average speed (s-coordinate) is 6m/s, and the magnitude of oscillation (d-coordinate) is 0.3.
The car's current average speed (s-coordinate) is 6m/s, and the magnitude of oscillation (d-coordinate) is 0.3.
The car's current average speed (s-coordinate) is 6m/s, and the magnitude of oscillation (d-coordinate) is 0.3.
The car is currently driving forwards at a speed of 6m/s, and the magnitude of oscillation (s-coordinate) is 0.3.
The car is not reversing, as the current average speed (s-coordinate) is not negative.
The car is not oscillating around the racing line, as the magnitude of oscillation (d-coordinate) is not larger than 0.3.
The car is not oscillating around the racing line, as the magnitude of oscillation (d-coordinate) is not larger than 0.3.
The car is not facing the wall, as the magnitude of oscillation (s-coordinate) is not 0.3.
The car is driving forwards at a speed of 6m/s, and the magnitude of oscillation (s-coordinate) is 0.3.
The car is not oscillating around the racing line, as the magnitude of oscillation (d-coordinate) is not larger than 0.3.
