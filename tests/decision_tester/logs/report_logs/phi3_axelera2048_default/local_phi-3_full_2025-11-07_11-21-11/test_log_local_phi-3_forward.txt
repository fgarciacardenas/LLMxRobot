        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: The car is adhering to what the human wants, which is to drive forward.
Explanation: The car's current s-speed is 5m/s, which is within the range of 5 to 7m/s that the human considers as driving forward. The car's s-coordinate is increasing, indicating it is moving forward. The car's deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is not zero, but it is not specified to be reversed, and the car's speed (s-speed) is not zero, so the car is not considered to be in the stopped state.
The car is adhering to what the human wants, which is to drive forward.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: The car is currently adhering to what the human wants, which is to drive forward.
The car's s-speed is consistently at 6.5m/s, which falls within the range of 5 to 7m/s that the human considers as driving forward. The car's s-coordinate is increasing, indicating it is moving forward. The car's deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is not zero, but it is not specified to be stopped, so the car is not considered to be stopped.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation:
The car is currently on the track, and the human wants it to oscillate around the racing line. The oscillation is determined by the d-coordinate, which represents the lateral deviation from the racing line. The car is oscillating if the d-coordinate alternates between positive and negative values with a magnitude greater than 0.3 meters.
Adhering to Human: True
The car's current d-coordinate values oscillate between 0.1 and -0.1 meters, which are both positive and negative deviations from the racing line. The magnitude of these oscillations is greater than 0.3 meters, and the car's speed (s-speed) is consistently 6 meters per second, which is negligible for the oscillation. The car is not reversing, as the s-coordinate values are increasing, and the car is not facing the wall, as the distance to the right wall (d-coordinate) is consistently greater than the distance to the left wall. The car's oscillation in the d-coordinate indicates that it is adhering to the human's command to oscillate around the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-coordinate is not close to 0m/s, which means the car is not reversing. The car's position along the racing line shows the car is on the centerline, as the s-coordinate is close to 0m/s.
Adhering to Human: True
The car is adhering to the human's request of driving on the centerline. The car's s-coordinate is close to 0m/s, which means the car is on the centerline. The car's position along the racing line shows the car is not close to the wall.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 0 seconds in 6 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, 4.8, 6]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.18, 0.16, 0.12]

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second.

        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.

Test Case: Drive on the racing line
Sample Index: 21
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 8 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.15, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.2]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 7, 6.8, 6.9, 6, 6.5, 7]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.15]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.4, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.3]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.7]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
