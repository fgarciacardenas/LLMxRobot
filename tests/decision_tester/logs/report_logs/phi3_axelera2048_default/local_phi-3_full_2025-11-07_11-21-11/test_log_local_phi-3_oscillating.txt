        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive close to the left wall 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 0 seconds in 14 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, -0.2, 0.3, -0.3, 0.2, -0.1, 0.3, -0.3, 0.2, -0.2, 0.3, -0.3, 0.1, -0.2]

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently driving on a racetrack with a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize lap time. The human wants the car to drive faster than 3 m/s.
Adhering to Human: False
The car's current average speed along the racing line (s-speed) is 6.5 m/s, which is between the usual driving speeds of 5 and 7 m/s. The car is not stopped, as the s-speed is not close to 0 m/s. The car is driving forward, as indicated by the fact that the car is not reversing (Bool if the car is reversing: False) and the car is not facing the wall (Bool if the car is facing the wall: False).
The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-speed) is -0.3 m/s, which is within the range of the car's d-speed (0.3 m/s to 0.5 m/s). This means the car is not moving at a speed that would make the car's lateral deviation above 0.5 m/s.
In summary, the car is driving at a speed (6.5 m/s) that is faster than the human's desired speed (3 m/s), but the car's lateral deviation (0.25 m/s) is not considered to be above the threshold (0.5 m/s).
The car is adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s, but the car's lateral deviation is not mentioned to be a concern for the human.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 11 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, -0.2, 0.3, -0.4, 0.2, -0.1, 0.4, -0.3, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.6, -0.7, 0.5, -0.6, 0.7, -0.5, 0.6, -0.7, 0.5, -0.6, 0.7]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6, 0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6, 0.8, 0.7, 0.9]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [0.7, 0.8, 0.6, 0.9, 0.7, 0.8, 0.6, 0.9, 0.7, 0.8, 0.6]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
