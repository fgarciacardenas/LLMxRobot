        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 10 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [15.3, 15.1, 14.9, 14.7, 14.5, 14.3, 14.1, 13.9, 13.7, 13.5]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0, -0.05, -0.1, -0.15, -0.2, -0.25]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [-0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [2.5, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9, 1.8, 1.7, 1.6]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: True

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: True


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Adhering to Human: True
The car is not reversing, and it is moving forward with a speed close to the desired 5-7m/s. The lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is minimal, indicating that the car is staying close to the racing line. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also minimal, which is expected for a car driving on a straight track. The distance to the left wall (1.5m) and right wall (0.8m) is within the normal range for a car on a track. The car is not in a reversed position, and it has not crashed.
The car is adhering to the human's command to drive forward, and the data suggests that the car is on a straight section of the track with minimal deviation from the racing line. The car appears to be driving at a speed within the normal range for a car on a track. The car is not in a reversed position, and it has not crashed. The car is driving forward on the track, and the human's command is being followed.

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: The car's current average speed and position along the racing line indicate that it is not adhering to the human's initial requirement.
Explanation: The car's s-coordinate shows a decreasing trend, which means it is moving away from the starting line. The car is currently at a speed of -3m/s, which is below the human's specified speed range of 5 to 7m/s. The car is not adhering to what the human wants.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The current average s-speed of the car along the racing line is calculated by taking the average of the s-speed values.
Average s-speed: (0.5 + 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.05) / 6 = 0.1083 m/s
Since the current average s-speed (0.1083 m/s) is less than the specified speed (0 m/s), the car is adhering to the human's request.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The AI must evaluate the car's current average speed along the racing line (s-coordinate) and determine if it is greater than the human's specified speed of 3 m/s.
Adhering to Human: True
The car's speed along the racing line (s-coordinate) is consistently -3 m/s, which is the opposite of the human's specified speed of 3 m/s. The car is not moving in the specified direction (d-coordinate) and the speed (d-speed) is close to 0 m/s, indicating that the car is stopped.
The car is not reversing (Bool if the car is reversing: False) and is not facing the wall (Bool if the car is facing the wall: False).
The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) varies between -0.1 m and -0.28 m, which is not relevant to the car's specified direction and speed.
The car's speed along the racing line (s-coordinate) is consistently -3 m/s, which is the opposite of the human's specified speed of 3 m/s. The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-coordinate) varies between -0.1 m/s and 0.15 m/s, which is not relevant to the car's specified speed. The distance to the left wall (s-coordinate) is consistently 0.05 m/s, which is not relevant to the car's specified speed.

Test Case: Drive on the racing line
Sample Index: 22
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 10 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [15.3, 15.1, 14.9, 14.7, 14.5, 14.3, 14.1, 13.9, 13.7, 13.5]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0, -0.05, -0.1, -0.15, -0.2, -0.25]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [-0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6, -0.6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [2.5, 2.4, 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0, 1.9, 1.8, 1.7, 1.6]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: True

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: True


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is oscillating around the racing line with a speed of 0.1m/s.
Adhering to Human: True
The car is currently driving on the racing line as per the given coordinates and speeds. The car's position along the racing line is oscillating between 14.3m and 13.5m, and the speed along the racing line is constant at 0.1m/s. The car is not facing the wall since the s-coordinate is not reducing over multiple samples. The car is driving forwards with a speed of 0.1m/s. The car is not reversing since the s-coordinate is not negative. The car is not crashing as the s-coordinate is not increasing over multiple samples. The car is not oscillating around the racing line with a speed of 0.3m/s or more since the s-speed is not oscillating between the d-speed and the negative of the d-speed. The car is driving at a speed between 5m/s and 7m/s, which is not applicable in this case. The car is driving at a speed of 0.1m/s, which is not between the human's desired speed of 0.1m/s and the car's current speed of 0.1m/s. The car is not in a state of crash, oscillation, reversing, or facing the wall, and the human's instructions are not contradictory.
