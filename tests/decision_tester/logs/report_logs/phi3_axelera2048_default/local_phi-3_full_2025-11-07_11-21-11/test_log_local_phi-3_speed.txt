        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 1:

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is 0.1m, and the distance to the left wall (0.8m) is below the threshold of 0.4m. The car is close to the wall as the deviation is below 0.4m.
Adhering to Human: True
The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is 0.1m, and the distance to the left wall (0.9m) is above the threshold of 0.4m. The car is not close to the wall as the distance is above 0.4m.
Adhering to Human: False
The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is 0.0m, and the distance to the left wall (1.0m) is at the threshold of 0.4m. The car is close to the wall as the deviation is at the threshold.

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.

        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.

Explanation: The car is currently driving on the racing line, as indicated by the s-coordinate values ranging from 0 to 55 meters. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is between 5 and 7 meters per second, which falls within the specified range. The car is not reversing since the s-speed is not negative, and the s-coordinate values are not reducing over multiple samples. The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) from the racing line is oscillating between 0.1 and 0.3 meters, which is a positive value, indicating that the car is not oscillating around the racing line. The car is not specified to be driving at a certain speed, and the current average speed of the car (s-speed) is not negative. The car is not specified to be facing the wall, and the s-coordinate values are not reducing over multiple samples. The car is adhering to the human's instructions for driving on the racing line.

Theory of Mind:
1. If you can only access the car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate), you can't tell if the car is driving on the racing line.
2. If the car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is not between 5 and 7m/s, then the car is not usually driving at those speeds.
3. If the car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is not between 0.1 and 0.2, then the car is not usually within the lateral deviation range.
4. If the car is not usually facing the same direction as the human, then the car is not an autonomous racing car.
5. If the car's distance to the left wall (s-coordinate) is not between 1.5 and 1.6, then the car is not usually driving at those distances from the right wall (d-coordinate).
6. If the car's distance to the right wall (d-coordinate) is not between 1.3 and 1.4, then the car is not usually driving at those distances from the left wall (s-coordinate).
7. If the car is usually driving at a speed between 5 and 7m/s, then the car is usually facing the same direction as the human.
8. If the car is not usually driving at a speed between 5 and 7m/s, then the car is not an autonomous racing car.
Observation: The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, 9]
Theory:
1. If the car is not usually driving at those distances from the right wall, then the car is not usually driving at those speeds.
2. If the car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is not between 0.1 and 0.2, then the car is not usually within that lateral deviation range.
3. If the car is not usually facing the same direction as the human, then the car is not an autonomous racing car.
