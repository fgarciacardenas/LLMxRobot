        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The racing line is a path on the racing track that allows the car to maintain the highest possible speed through a corner. It is a minimal curvature trajectory that optimizes the car's performance and lap time.
Adhering to Human: True
The car is currently on the track, and the data provided in the Frenet Corrélation frame is in the following format:
- s-coordinate (position along the racing line): [30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30]
- d-coordinate (lateral deviation from the racing line): [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
- s-speed (speed along the racing line): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
- d-speed (speed perpendicular to the racing line): [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
- Bool (distance to the left wall): [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8]
- Bool (car crashing): False
- Bool (car facing the wall): False
The car is not currently reversing or crashing, and the Bool values are all set to False. The car is driving forwards, and the Bool values are set to False, indicating that the car is not facing the wall.
To maintain the highest possible speed through the corner, the car should follow the racing line. The car's current lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is oscillating between positive and negative values with a magnitude of 0.3 meters, which means the car is oscillating around the racing line.
To summarize the car's current situation and the human's requirements, the car is adhering to the racing line and driving forwards, but it is not facing the wall. The Bool values are all set to False, indicating that the car is not crashing or reversing.

        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is adhering to the human's instructions to drive on the racing line.
Adhering to Human: True
The car is adhering to the human's instructions to drive on the racing line.
Sanitized Output: True
Expected Output: False
