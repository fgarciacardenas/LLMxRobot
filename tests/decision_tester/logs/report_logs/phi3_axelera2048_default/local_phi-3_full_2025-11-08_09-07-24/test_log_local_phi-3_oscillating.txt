Test Case: Drive forward
Sample Index: 7
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive forward 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 4 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 21, 27, 34]
