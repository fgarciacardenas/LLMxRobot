The car's current average speed along the racing line (s-speed) is 6m/s, which is within the human's specified range of 5-7m/s. However, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is oscillating between 0.1m and 0.3m, indicating that the car is not maintaining a consistent distance from the racing line.\nTo improve the situation, the car should adjust its steering to minimize the lateral deviation and better adhere to the racing line. This can be achieved by making small steering corrections to keep the car centered on the line.\nStaying close to the wall (d-coordinate) is also essential for optimal racing line adherence. The car's current distance to the right wall (d-coordinate) is oscillating between 1.3m and 1.5m, which is within the human's specified range of 0.4m to 1.5m. The car is maintaining a safe distance from the wall, but it should aim for a more consistent value to stay further from the wall and closer to the racing line.\nIn summary, the car is not adhering to the human's instruction to drive forward, as it is oscillating around the racing", "sanitized_output": false, "structure_followed": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 724, "rag_tokens": 173, "output_tokens": 315, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}
