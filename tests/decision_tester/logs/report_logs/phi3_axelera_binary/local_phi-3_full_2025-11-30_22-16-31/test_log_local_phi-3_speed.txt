Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 3 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1.8, 3.6]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.15, 0.2]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.3, 0.3, 0.3]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.2, 1.1, 1.0]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.0, 1.1, 1.2]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Don't move. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: <False>
Reasoning:
The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate, and the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate. The car is not supposed to be reversing, and the s-speed should be close to 0m/s when the car is close to the wall.
1. The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1.8, 3.6]
2. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.15, 0.2]
3. The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6]
4. The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.3, 0.3, 0.3]
5. The distance to the left wall is given by the s-coordinate: [1.2, 1.1, 1.0]
6. The distance to the right wall is given by the s-coordinate: [0.4, 0.4, 0.4]
7. The car is not supposed to be reversing: [False, 0, 0]
8. The car is not supposed to be facing the wall: [True, 0.3, 0.4]
The car is not adhering to the human's instruction of staying close to the wall, as the car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is above the threshold of 0.3m. The car is also supposed to be facing the wall, but the car's orientation (d-coordinate) is not the same as the distance to the wall (s-coordinate).

Explanation: The car is currently driving at a speed of 5m/s, which is within the desired range of 5 to 7m/s. However, the car is at a distance of 1.1m from the right wall, which is not less than 0.4m. So, the car is not close enough to the wall.
The car is oscillating around the racing line with a d-coordinate that goes from 0.1m to 0.2m, then back to 0.1m, and finally to 0.0m. The magnitudes of the oscillations are all less than 0.3m, which means the car is close to the racing line.
The car is facing the wall with a distance of 1.1m, which is greater than 0.4m.
Considering the above information, the car is not adhering to the human's instructions.

The car's distance to the walls is oscillating between 0.8 and 1.2 meters, which is within the human's specified range of 0.4 to 1.2 meters. This means that the car is not staying close to the wall, as the human wants.
The car's bool values for crashing, reversing, and facing the wall are all False, which means the car is not in a crashed state, not reversing, and not facing the wall.
In summary, the car is oscillating around the racing line, and its distance to the walls is within the human's specified range. However, the car is not maintaining a consistent distance from the racing line, and it is not staying

Explanation:
1. The car is not driving forward as indicated by the d-coordinate oscillating from positive to negative values, which means the car is not following the racing line strictly.
2. The current average speed of the car along the racing line can be calculated by averaging the s-coordinates: (5.2 + 5.3 + 5.5 + 5.6 + 5.4 + 5.7 + 5.5 + 5.6 + 5.7 + 5.4) / 10 = 5.45 m/s. This speed is within the range specified by the human (5 to 7 m/s).
3. The car is not maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m from the wall as the distance to the wall is given by the d-coordinate and it varies from 0.1 to 0.3m, which is above the threshold.
4. The car is not reversing

Model Response: Adhering to Human: False
Explanation:
The car is not adhering to the human's command to drive forward. Instead, it is following a racing line that minimizes the distance to the wall, which is not the same as driving straight ahead. The car's current position along the racing line (s-coordinate) and its lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) indicate that it is oscillating around the racing line. The oscillation in the d-coordinate values with a magnitude of 0.2 and 0.1, alternating between positive and negative, shows that the car is deviating from the desired straight line (d-coordinate) and is instead following a path that keeps it close to the wall. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) and the distance to the wall (1.5m) are consistent with the car staying close to the wall, but the car is not facing the wall, nor is it driving forward in the context of the human's command.

Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) oscillates between -0.05 and 0.05, which are both smaller than the negligible thresholds of 0.3m. The car's speed (s-speed) is within the specified range of 5 to 7m/s. The car is not necessarily facing the wall (Bool if the car is facing the wall: False) and is not reversing (Bool if the car is reversing: False). The car's oscillation in the lateral direction (d-coordinate) indicates that it is oscillating around the racing line (Bool if the car is oscillating: True).
The provided hints and data are all relevant to the car's current state and the human's command. The car is adhering to the human's command to oscillate around the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: <False>
Explanation:
The car is not adhering to the human's instructions because the distance to the right wall is not about 1.5m, as the car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is oscillating between -0.05m and 0.3m, which means the car is not maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m from the centerline. The car should be oscillating around the racing line with a smaller magnitude of deviation to be considered on the centerline.

Model Response: Adhering to Human: False
The car is not adhering to the human's request to drive on the centerline. The car is oscillating around the racing line with a d-coordinate of 0.15m, which is below the threshold of 0.3m for considering the car to be on the racing line. The car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is also increasing by 1.8m, which is consistent with the car driving on the centerline. However, the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is 0.3m, which is below the threshold of 0.3m for considering the car to be on the racing line. This indicates that the car is not maintaining a consistent distance from the centerline and is oscillating around the racing line. The car is also getting closer to the wall, which is not consistent with the goal of staying on the racing line. The car should maintain a consistent distance from the centerline and not be reversing or crashing.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: To determine if the car is adhering to the human's request of driving faster than 3 m/s, we need to calculate the average speed of the car along the racing line (s-coordinate) and perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed).
Average s-speed = (4.5 + 5.0 + 5.5 + 5.0 + 4.5 + 5.0 + 5.5 + 5.0) / 8 = 35.5 / 8 = 4.4375 m/s
Average d-speed = (0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.1) / 8 = 1.3 / 8 = 0.1625 m/s
Now, let's check if the car is adhering to the human's request:
Drive faster than 3 m/s:
Adhering to Human: <False>
The car's average s-speed (4.4375 m/s) is greater than the human's specified minimum speed (3 m/s), and the oscillations in the d-speed (0.1625 m/s) are also within the acceptable range (0.1 m/s).

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False
Explanation:
1. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is given as [4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6], which means the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7 m/s. This matches the human's expectation of speeds between 5 and 7 m/s.
2. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is given as [0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1]. The negative values indicate the car is at times driving in the opposite direction of the racing line. However, the oscillations in the d-coordinate are within the acceptable range of 0.1m, which is not considered a crash or a significant deviation.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False
Explanation:
The car's current average speed along the racing line (s-speed) is calculated by summing the s-speeds and dividing by the number of samples.
Average s-speed = (4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 6) / 7 = 31 / 7 = 4.43 m/s
Since the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7 m/s, and the current average speed is 4.43 m/s, which is below the threshold of 5 m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's usual driving speed.
However, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is given by the samples, and the maximum allowed deviation is 0.3 m. The car's current lateral deviation is within the acceptable range, as the maximum deviation in the provided data is 0.3 m.
The car is not facing the wall, as the car's distance to the left wall (0.8 m) is less than the distance to the right wall (1.2 m).
Considering the above information, the car is not adhering to the human's requirements.

The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) from the racing line is within the acceptable range of oscillations (0.3m or less), and the car is not reversing (Bool if the car is reversing: False). The car is also not facing the wall (Bool if the car is facing the wall: False). Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's request to drive at a certain speed.

Model Response: Adhering to Human: False
Explanation: The current average speed of the car along the racing line (s-speed) is calculated by summing the s-speed values and dividing by the number of samples: (4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4) / 7 = 35 / 7 = 5 m/s. Since the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7 m/s, it is not adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s.

The car's current speed along the racing line (s-speed) is given as 5 to 7 meters per second, which is already faster than the specified 3 meters per second. The lateral deviation (d-speed) is also above the threshold of 0.5 meters per second, indicating that the car is not close to the racing line. The oscillations in the d-coordinate are within the negligible range, so they do not affect the car's state. Since the car is not facing the wall, it is not in a crash position. The car is not stopped as it is moving along the racing line. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's requirements of driving faster than 3 m/s.

The current average speed of the car along the racing line (s-coordinate) is calculated by summing the speeds and dividing by the number of samples:
(5 + 5.5 + 6 + 5.8 + 6.2 + 5.7 + 5.9 + 6.1 + 5.5) / 9 = 5.5m/s
Since the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s, the car is not adhering to the human's usual speed. However, the car is not required to drive faster than 3m/s, and the current average speed is 5.5m/s, which is within the human's specified range.
The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) from the racing line is calculated by summing the deviations and dividing by the number of samples:
(0.2 + (-0.1) + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.1 + (-0.1) + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.1) / 9 = 0.1m
The oscillations in the d-coordinate under 0.3m are negligible, and the current deviation is

Model Response: Adhering to Human: False
Explanation: The car is not adhering to the human's instructions to drive on the racing line based on the following reasons:
1. The car's s-coordinate (position along the racing line) is not consistently decreasing. The car should be driving on a path where the s-coordinate decreases with time, indicating it is following the racing line.
2. The car's d-coordinate (lateral deviation from the racing line) is oscillating between 0.05m and 0.1m, which is within the acceptable range (0m to 0.3m) for the racing line.
3. The car's s-speed (speed along the racing line) is not consistently decreasing. The car should be driving faster on the racing line, as indicated by the s-speed (speed perpendicular to the racing line) increasing with time.
4. The car's d-speed (speed perpendicular to the racing line) is oscillating between 0.2m and 0.3m, which is not consistent with the car driving on the racing line.
5. The car's distance to the left wall (1.5m) and the right wall (1.5m) are not equal, which means the car is not close to the wall (0.4m) and should be maintaining a consistent distance from the centerline.
6. The car's Bool values (indicating the car's orientation) are not False, which means the car is not facing the wall.
Based on the given data and the car's behavior, it is not following the human's instructions to drive on the racing line.

        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False
The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate, and the d-coordinate represents the lateral deviation from the racing line. The car is not adhering to the human's instructions because the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3m (0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.1, 0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0, -0.1, -0.2). This indicates that the car is oscillating around the racing line, which is not the desired behavior.
The car is also not maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m from the centerline (1,
