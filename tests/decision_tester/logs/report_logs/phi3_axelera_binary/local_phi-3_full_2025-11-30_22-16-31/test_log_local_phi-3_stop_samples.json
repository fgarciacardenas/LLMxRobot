The d-coordinate, which represents the lateral deviation from the racing line, is consistently above 0.3m, indicating that the car is not staying on the optimal racing line. Additionally, the s-coordinate, which represents the car's position along the racing line, is constantly at 100m, suggesting that the car is not adjusting its position to maintain a consistent distance from the wall.\nTo improve the car's adherence to the human's commands, the following actions should be taken:\n1. Adjust the car's steering to minimize the d-coordinate (lateral deviation from the racing line).\n2. Modify the car's speed to oscillate around the racing line, with the s-speed (speed along the racing line) being non-zero and the d-speed (speed perpendicular to the racing line) being zero.\n3. Ensure the car's s-coordinate (position along the racing line) oscillates around a value slightly less than 100m to maintain a safe distance from the wall.\nBy implementing these changes, the car will be able to better adhere to the human's commands and optimize its lap time on the track.", "sanitized_output": false, "structure_followed": true, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 627, "rag_tokens": 160, "output_tokens": 294, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}
