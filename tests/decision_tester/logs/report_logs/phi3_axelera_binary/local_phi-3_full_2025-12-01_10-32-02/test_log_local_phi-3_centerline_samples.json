The car's current average speed is calculated as the mean of the s-speed values: (6 + 6.5 + 7) / 3 = 6.5m/s. Since the car is not reversing (Bool if the car is reversing: False) and the car's speed is within the expected range (Bool if the car has crashed: False), the car is not in a crash state. The car's orientation (Bool if the car is facing the wall: False) and the fact that it's not reversing suggest that the car is facing forward and moving. The car's lateral deviation (Bool if the car is turning left or right: False) indicates that the car is on the racing line (Bool if the car is turning left or right: False). The car's s-coordinate values are constant, which means the car is neither accelerating nor decelerating significantly (Bool if the car is accelerating or decelerating: False). The car's current speed (6.5m/s) is between the minimum and maximum speeds (5m/s to 7m/s) that the human can drive without crashing (Bool if the car is crashing: False). The car is not stopped (Bool if the car is stopped: False) because the car's s-speed is not close to 0m/s.\nBased on the above analysis and the given hints, the AI concludes that the car is facing forward (Bool if the car is facing the wall: False) and moving at a speed within the human-driven range (Bool if the car is crashing: False).

Since the car's current lateral deviation is 0 meters, it is not considered close to the wall.\nThe car is also not in the correct state to be considered stopped, as its s-speed (speed along the racing line) is at 6 meters per second, which is the racing line's speed.\nIn summary, the car is not adhering to the human's request to drive close to the left wall, as it is not within the specified deviation distance of 0.4 meters from the racing line.", "sanitized_output": false, "structure_followed": true, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 550, "rag_tokens": 145, "output_tokens": 258, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}
