The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also within the range of 0.2 to 0.3 m/s.\nTo check if the car is driving faster than 3 m/s, we can look at the s-speed and d-speed values. Since the s-speed is 6 m/s, which is greater than the minimum required speed of 3 m/s, the car is currently driving faster than the human wants.\nHowever, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is -0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3. This means that the car is not always driving at the specified speed of 6 m/s along the racing line.\nTo improve the situation, the car should focus on maintaining a consistent speed of 6 m/s along the racing line, as it is currently doing in some instances. The car should also pay attention to its lateral deviation, ensuring it stays within the limits of the racing line.\nIn summary, the car is not adhering to the human's request of driving faster than 3 m/s, as it is currently meeting the desired speed along the racing line", "sanitized_output": false, "structure_followed": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 690, "rag_tokens": 135, "output_tokens": 347, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}
