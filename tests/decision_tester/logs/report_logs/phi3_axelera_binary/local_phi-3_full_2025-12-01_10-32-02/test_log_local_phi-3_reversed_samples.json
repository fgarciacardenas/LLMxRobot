This indicates that the car is not reversing.

The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is oscillating between positive and negative values, but the magnitude of the deviation is not large enough to suggest that the car is crashing.

The car is not adhering to the usual instructions of facing the wall, as the car's speed along the racing line is not close to 0m/s. The car is not adhering to the usual instructions of reversing, as the car's speed along the racing line is not negative.

The car is not adhering to the given instructions.\nReasoning:\nThe car is currently driving on the racing line, not the centerline. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is positive, indicating it is off the centerline.\nData Analysis:\nThe car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is decreasing by 1 unit in each sample, which means the car is moving in the negative s-direction (towards the starting line). The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is constant at -2 m/s, which is negative and indicates the car is moving in the negative s-direction.\nThe car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is constant at 0.1 m/s, which means the car is not maintaining a constant distance from the wall.\nThe distance to the left wall (l-coordinate) is increasing by 0.1 unit in each sample, and the distance to the right wall (r-coordinate) is decreasing by 0.1 unit in each sample. This shows that the car is not maintaining a constant distance from the centerline.\nTo summarize the car's behavior:\n- The car is not driving on the centerline.\n- The car is moving in the negative s-direction.\n- The car is not maintaining a constant distance from the wall.\nThe car is not adhering to the given instructions.", "sanitized_output": false, "structure_followed": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 611, "rag_tokens": 141, "output_tokens": 337, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}
