The corresponding s-speeds are [6, 6, 6], showing the car is maintaining a constant speed of 6 meters per second along the racing line.\nThe car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinates) are [0.1, 0.15, 0.2], which are all positive values. This means the car has not crossed the racing line, and the car is not reversing (Bool if the car is reversing: False).\nThe car's s-speed (s-speed) is [6, 6, 6], which is constant and equal to the car's s-coordinate. This confirms the car is not deviating from the racing line (not going left or right faster than the optimal racing line speed).\nThe car's d-speed (d-speed) is [0.3, 0.3, 0.3], which is constant and equal to the car's s-speed. This confirms the car is not deviating from the racing line (not going left or right faster than the optimal racing line speed).\nThe Bool if the car has crashed (Bool if the car has crashed) and the Bool if the car is facing the wall (Bool if the car is facing the wall) are both False, which means the car has not crashed and is not facing the wall.\nBased on the information provided and the analysis of the Frenet Coordinate Frame data, the car is adhering to the racing line as commanded by the human.", "sanitized_output": true, "structure_followed": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 419, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 443, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}
