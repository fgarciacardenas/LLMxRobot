The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate, which is [10, 10, 10, 10, 10], indicating that the car is on the racing line. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate, which is [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]. This means that the car is deviating by 0.5 meters from the racing line at different points.\nThe car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed, which is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This indicates that the car is not maintaining a constant speed along the racing line. The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed, which is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This indicates that the car is not moving at all perpendicular to the racing line.\nThe distance to the left wall is given by the s-coordinate, which is [0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3]. This indicates that the car is maintaining a constant distance of 0.3 meters from the left wall. The distance to the right wall is given by the d-coordinate, which is [0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3]. This indicates that the car is also maintaining a constant distance of 0.3 meters from the right wall.\nThe Bool if the car is reversing is False, which indicates that the car is not currently in the process of reversing. The Bool if the car has crashed is False, which indicates that the car is not currently in a crash. The Bool if the car is facing the wall is False, which indicates that the car is not currently facing the wall.\nIn summary, the car is not adhering to what the human wants, which is to drive close to the left wall.", "sanitized_output": false, "structure_followed": true, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 463, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 488, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}

To drive faster than 3 m/s, the car needs to accelerate. The car's lateral deviation (d) from the racing line is consistently 0.2 m, which indicates that the car is not perfectly on the racing line. The car is not reversing, and there is no indication of a crash. The car is facing the wall, but it's not clear if the car is facing the wall or the trackside marker. The car's current position along the racing line (s) is 50 m, and the distance to the left and right walls is 0.8 m and 0.9 m, respectively.\nTo answer the question of whether the car is driving faster than 3 m/s, we need to consider the car's speed along the racing line (s-speed). The car's current speed along the racing line is 0 m/s, which means the car is not moving relative to the racing line. However, the distance to the left and right walls is given, which allows us to infer the car's actual ground speed.\nThe car's lateral deviation (d) from the racing line is consistently 0.2 m, which means the car is not perfectly on the racing line. The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory, which is the shortest path between two points on the track. The car's current position along the racing line (s) is 50 m, and the distance to the left and right walls is 0.8 m and 0.9 m, respectively.\nTo determine if the car is driving faster than 3 m/s, we need to consider the car's actual ground speed. The car's current position along the racing line (s) is 50 m, and the distance to the left and right walls is 0.8 m and 0.9 m, respectively. The car's current ground speed (s-speed) is 0 m/s, which means the car is not moving relative to the racing line.\nTo calculate the car's actual ground speed, we can use the Pythagorean theorem.
