The d-coordinate represents the car's lateral deviation from the racing line, and the d-speed represents the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line.\nThe car's current position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [5, 12, 19]. The corresponding lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.35, 0.3, 0.25].

The d-coordinate indicates the car's lateral deviation from the racing line. A value of 0.35m for the d-coordinate suggests the car is oscillating around the racing line, which is not ideal for optimal racing line adherence.\nExplanation: The car's s-coordinate (0.1m) indicates the distance to the apex of the turn, and the d-coordinate (0.35m) suggests the car is close to the apex but not on the racing line. The car's speed along the racing line (6m/s) is consistent with the s-coordinate, but the d-speed (0.1m/s) is not oscillating, which means the car is not maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m from the racing line.\nExplanation: The Bool values for reversing (False) and facing the wall (False) indicate the car is not in a position to be considered reversing or facing the wall. The car's current position (0.35m) is less than the threshold of 0.4m, which means the car is close to the wall.\nAdhering to Human: True", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 631, "rag_tokens": 160, "output_tokens": 279, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}
