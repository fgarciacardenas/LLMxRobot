The distance to the left wall is 1m, and the distance to the right wall is oscillating between 1.5m and 1m, which is not considered to be the wall (distance below 0.4m).

This suggests that the car is not accelerating or decelerating as it should be to maintain the desired speed.\nThe car's current lateral speed (0.7m/m) is higher than the specified limit (0.3m/s). This means the car is moving too close to the wall, which is not the desired behavior.\nThe car's current distance to the left wall is 1.1m, which is within the specified limit of 0.4m. This indicates that the car is not maintaining a consistent distance from the wall.\nThe car's current distance to the right wall is 1.4m, which is also within the specified limit of 0.4m.

The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is 0.8 meters, which is larger than the threshold of 0.4 meters. This deviation indicates that the car is not driving straight on the racing line.\nThe car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is 6 meters per second, which is within the human-specified range of 5 to 7 meters per second. This speed is consistent with the human's desired speed range.\nThe car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is 0.9 meters per second, which is larger than the threshold of 0.3 meters per second. This deviation indicates that the car is not maintaining a consistent distance below 0.3 meters from the wall.\nBased on the given data and the provided hints, the car is not driving forward as it is not maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4 meters from the racing line.\nAdhering to Human: False\nAdhering to Human's desired speed range: True\nAdhering to Human's desired distance from the wall: False\nThe car is currently not", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": false, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 668, "rag_tokens": 173, "output_tokens": 372, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}
