The car is facing the center of the track, not the wall (Bool if the car is reversing: False).\n6. The car is facing the wall, but not close to it (Bool if the car is facing the wall: False).\n7.

The car's position along the racing line is at 30 meters, and the acceptable lateral deviation is within 0.1 meters. The car's speed along the racing line is 5.5 meters per second, and the speed perpendicular to the racing line is within the acceptable range (0.2 meters).
