The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is not negative, and the car is not crashed, as the car is not facing the wall.
The car's current state and the human's command are as follows:
- The car's position along the racing line is [10, 15, 20]
- The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is [0, 0, 0]
- The car's speed along the racing line is [6, 6, 6]

Model Response: Explanation: The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate, and the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate. The car is oscillating around the racing line if the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres.
Adhering to Human: True
The car is not adhering to what the human wants, which is to oscillate. The d-coordinates provided are all the same (0.1), indicating that the car is not deviating from the racing line.

Test Case: Drive close to the left wall
Sample Index: 5
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive close to the left wall 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 6 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation>

Model Response: Explanation: To determine if the car is driving on the centerline, we need to check if the car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is approximately equal to the distance to the left and right walls.
Adhering to Human: False
The car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is [5, 10, 15], which means the car is not driving on the centerline as it should be at a distance of 5 meters from the centerline. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is [6, 6, 6], which is within the expected range of 5 to 7 meters per second. The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is [0.1, 0.1, 0.1], which is also within the expected range of 0.1 meters per second. The car is not reversing since the Bool for "is facing the wall" is False, and the Bool for "is reversing" is False.
The car is not adhering to the human's request to drive on the centerline, as it should be at a distance of 5 meters from the centerline.

Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently driving on the centerline, as indicated by the equal distances to the left and right walls. The s-coordinate values are increasing, which means the car is moving forward. The s-speed values are also increasing, which implies the car is accelerating. The d-speed values are zero, indicating the car is not deviating from the racing line.
Hint 11: The car is not reversing, as the Bool for reversing is False.
Hint 10: The car is on the centerline, as the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 9: The car is not facing the wall, as the Bool for facing the wall is False.
Hint 2: The car is not driving on the centerline, as the Bool for centerline is True.
Hint 5: The car is not driving at a negative s-speed, as the Bool for s-speed is True.
Adhering to Human: False

Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently driving at an average speed of 6 m/s along the racing line, which is within the usual speed range of 5 to 7 m/s. The car is not reversing and is facing the right direction. However, the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is 0 m/s, indicating that the car is not moving towards the left wall as it should be.
Adhering to Human: False
To increase the car's speed, the human should consider the following:
1. The car's current speed is within the usual range (5-7 m/s).
2. The car is not moving towards the left wall (d-speed is 0 m/s).
To increase the car's speed, the human should focus on the car's movement towards the left wall, as this will help the car to adhere to the racing line and potentially increase its speed.

Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently on the track, and the human wants it to drive faster than 3 m/s.
Adhering to Human: False
The car is not adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is given as [5, 6, 6, 5, 5], which means it is already driving at the maximum speed of 6 m/s. The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is given as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means it is not deviating from the racing line. The car is either on a straight section of the track or a part of the racing line where the s-speed is close to 0m/s, which is not the case here. The car is either not on the track or not facing the wall. The car is facing the track, and the human is not asking for the car to be stopped.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation:
To drive on the racing line, the car must follow the s-coordinate values [0, 2, 4] with a lateral deviation of 0.1m and a speed of 6m/s. The car is not reversing, and it is facing the correct direction.
Current Average Speed: The car's current average speed can be calculated by taking the mean of the s-coordinates and the s-speeds. (0 + 2 + 4) / 3 = 6 / 3 = 2m. The car's current average speed is 2m/s.
The car is not reversing, and it is facing the right direction.
Current Average Speed: The car's current average speed is 2m/s.
The car's current average speed is within the range of 5 to 7m/s.
The car is not oscillating around the racing line, as the d-coordinate values are the same (0.1, 0.1, 0.1).
The car is not oscillating around the racing line.
The car is not adhering to the human's request to drive at a certain speed.
The car is not adhering to the human's request.
The car is not adhering to the human's request.
Adjusting the car's speed to the human's request: The car's current average speed is 2m/s, and the human's requested speed is between 6 and 7m/s. The car is not adhering to the human's request.
Adjusting the car's speed to the human's request: The car is not adhering to the human's request.
