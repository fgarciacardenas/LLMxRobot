The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate, the lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate, the car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed, and the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed.\nHints:\n1. The car is oscillating around the racing line if the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 meters.\n2. The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed, and the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed.\nAdhering to Human: True\nThe car is oscillating around the racing line because the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with a magnitude larger than 0.3 meters. The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed, and the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed.\nExplanation:\nThe car is oscillating around the racing line because the d-coordinate shows a pattern of oscillation from positive to negative values with a magnitude larger than 0.3 meters. This indicates that the car is not following the racing line strictly and is instead making lateral movements (oscillations) with respect to the racing line.\nAdhering to Human: True\nThe car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed, which remains constant at 6 meters per second.
