The data provided in the Frenet Corrider frame indicates the car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) and the distance to the right wall (distance to the left wall - distance to the right wall). The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) and the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) are also given.\nThe d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with a magnitude of 0.15m, which is less than the 0.3m threshold. The d-speed is constant at 0.3m/s, which is less than the 0.5m/s threshold.\nAdhering to Human: True\nThe car is oscillating around the racing line with a magnitude of deviation (0.15m) that is less than the 0.3m threshold. The car is not reversing, as the s-coordinate is increasing, and the car is not crashing, as the distance to the right wall is increasing. The car is facing the correct direction, as the car's speed is given in the s-speed, which is the same as the car's position along the racing line.\nExplanation:\nThe car's oscillation around the racing line is within the negligible range for the magnitude of deviation. The car is not reversing, as the s-coordinate is increasing, and the car is not crashing, as the distance to the right wall is increasing. The car is facing the correct direction, as the car's speed is given in the s-speed, which is the same as the car's position along the racing line.\nAdhering to Human: True", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 583, "rag_tokens": 150, "output_tokens": 391, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}
