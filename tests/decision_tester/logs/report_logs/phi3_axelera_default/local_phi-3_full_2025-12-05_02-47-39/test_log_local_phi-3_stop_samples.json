The car is currently stopped, with a lateral deviation from the racing line, but the car is not moving towards the wall or the specified direction.\nExplanation: The car is not adhering to the human's request, as it is stopped and not perfectly aligned with the racing line.\nAdhering to Human: False", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": false, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 611, "rag_tokens": 141, "output_tokens": 389, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}

The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is 0.2m, which is within the acceptable range of staying close to the wall (0.4m).

The Bool if the car is facing the wall is True, as the car is currently on the centerline. The Bool if the car is facing the wall is False, as the car is on the racing line. The Bool if the car is staying close to the wall is True, as the lateral deviation is within the acceptable range.

In this case, the car is currently stopped (0 m/s) along the racing line, and the human wants it to drive faster than 3 m/s.\nTo achieve this, the AI can calculate the required throttle input to reach a speed of 3 m/s and then apply a logic to gradually increase the speed while maintaining the car's stability and control. The AI can also consider the minimal curvature trajectory (racing line) to optimize the lap time and the car's handling.\nIn summary, the AI can adhere to the human's request by adjusting the car's speedometer reading to be greater than 3 m/s and ensuring the car follows the racing line for better performance.", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 617, "rag_tokens": 135, "output_tokens": 324, "model_name": "local_phi-3"}
