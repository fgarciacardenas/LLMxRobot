        The car is driving forward as indicated by the positive s-coordinate values. The car's speed is within the typical range of 5 to 7 m/s, and it is not reversing or facing the wall. The car is not oscillating around the racing line as the d-coordinate values are not showing significant positive to negative oscillations. The car is maintaining a safe distance from the walls, as none of the distances to the walls are below 0.4m. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's instruction to drive forward.

- answer: To calculate the finish time for baking all 3 batches of cookies, we need to add the total baking time to the start time.


Each batch takes 12 minutes to bake, so for 3 batches:

Total baking time = 3 batches * 12 minutes/batch = 36 minutes


Start time: 1:00 PM


Adding 36 minutes to 1:00 PM:

1:00 PM + 36 minutes = 1:36 PM


Therefore, you will finish baking all the batches of cookies at 1:36 PM.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 10 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [-0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3]

        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
