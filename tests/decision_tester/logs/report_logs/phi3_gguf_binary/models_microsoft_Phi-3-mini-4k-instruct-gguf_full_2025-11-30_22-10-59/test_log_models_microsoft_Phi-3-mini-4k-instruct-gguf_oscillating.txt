Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: 

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Maintain a steady speed on the racing line

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 

        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 10 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.5, -0ayer, 0.4, -0.4, 0.3, -0.3, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1, -0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 7, 6.8, 6.2, 6.5, 7, 6.6, 6.3, 6.4]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.6, -0.6, 0.5, -0.5, 0.4, -0.4, 0.3, -0.3, 0.2, -0.2]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.4, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4]
