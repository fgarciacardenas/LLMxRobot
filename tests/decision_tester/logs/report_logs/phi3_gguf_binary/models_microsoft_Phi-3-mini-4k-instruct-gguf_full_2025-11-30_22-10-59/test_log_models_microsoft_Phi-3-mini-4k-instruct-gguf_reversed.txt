# Answer

To bake all 3 batches of cookies, you would need to multiply the time it takes to bake one batch by the number of batches.


12 minutes/batch * 3 batches = 36 minutes


Therefore, it will take 36 minutes to bake all 3 batches of cookies.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 9 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 9.8, 9.6, 9.4, 9.2, 9, 8.8, 8.6, 8.4]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0, -0.05, -0.1, -0.15, -0.2]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [-0.2, -0.2, -0.2, -0.2, -0.2, -0.2, -0.2, -0.2, -0.2]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [-0.05, -0.05, -0.05, -0.05, -0.05, -0.05, -0.05, -0.05, -0.05]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: True

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

# Answer

To calculate the total time needed to bake all 3 batches of cookies, we multiply the time it takes to bake one batch by the number of batches:


12 minutes/batch * 3 batches = 36 minutes


Starting at 1:00 PM, we add 36 minutes to find the finishing time:


1:00 PM + 36 minutes = 1:36 PM


Therefore, you will finish baking all the batches of cookies at 1:36 PM.
