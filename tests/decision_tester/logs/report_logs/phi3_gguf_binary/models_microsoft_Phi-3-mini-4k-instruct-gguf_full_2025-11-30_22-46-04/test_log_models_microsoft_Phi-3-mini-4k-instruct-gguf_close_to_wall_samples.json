If the oven temperature increases by 25\u00b0F for each subsequent batch, what will be the baking time for the fourth batch if the time decreases by 1 minute for each 25\u00b0F increase in temperature?\n\n- answer: To determine the baking time for the fourth batch, we need to first identify the pattern in the temperature and time changes.\n\n\n1. First batch: 350\u00b0F for 12 minutes\n\n2. Second batch: 375\u00b0F (350\u00b0F + 25\u00b0F) for 10 minutes (12 minutes - 2 minutes)\n\n3.
