        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
