# Answer

To calculate the total time required to bake all 3 batches of cookies, you simply multiply the time it takes to bake one batch by the number of batches:


12 minutes/batch × 3 batches = 36 minutes


Therefore, it will take 36 minutes to bake all 3 batches of cookies.

Test Case: Drive on the racing line
Sample Index: 24
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 10 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False
