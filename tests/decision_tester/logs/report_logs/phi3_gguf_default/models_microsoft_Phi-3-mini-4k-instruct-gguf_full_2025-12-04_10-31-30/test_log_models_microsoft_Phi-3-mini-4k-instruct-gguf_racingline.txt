Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 10 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Sample Index: 2
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive faster than 3 m/s 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 8 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.05, 0.02, -0.01, 0.04, 0.08, 0.1, 0.05]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 6.2, 6.8, 7, 6.5, 6.3, 6.8]

        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: 

        Explanation: The car's average speed is within the usual range of 5 to 7 m/s, and none of the speeds exceed 7 m/s, so it is not adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s.

Model Response: 
- [response]: Explanation: The car's current average speed along the racing line is calculated by summing the s-speed values and dividing by the number of samples. The average speed is (6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6)/9 = 6 m/s. This is within the usual driving speed range of 5 to 7 m/s but does not meet the human's requirement of driving faster than 3 m/s.
