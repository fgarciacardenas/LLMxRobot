Model Response: 
        Explanation: The car is not moving as the s-speed is constant at 3.5m/s, which is not close to 0m/s, indicating the car is not stopped. The car is not reversing since the d-coordinate is not above 0.3m. The car is not facing the wall as the d-coordinate is not consistently negative. The car is not close to either wall since the distance to both walls is 1.5m, which is greater than 0.4m. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's wish to not move.

- [response]: Explanation: The car is not moving as indicated by the s-speed values, which are all positive and relatively constant, suggesting a steady speed along the racing line. The car is also not reversing, as the d-coordinate values are not negative, and there is no indication of a crash. The car is not facing the wall since the d-speed values are not significantly deviating from the s-speed, and the distances to the walls are not below 0.4m, which would indicate a close proximity to the walls.

- [response]: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) from the racing line is consistently below 0.4m, indicating that it is maintaining a distance below 0.4m from the walls. However, the car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is above 0.5m/s, which suggests that the car is not moving too fast sideways. The car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is increasing, indicating forward movement. The car is not reversing and has not crashed. The car is not facing the wall, as the distance to the right wall is consistently greater than the distance to the left wall.

- [response]: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) from the racing line is within the range of 0.1m to 0.2m, which indicates that the car is maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m from the left wall. This suggests that the car is driving close to the left wall, as per the human's request.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive close to the left wall 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 13 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1.5, 3.1, 4.6, 6.2, 7.7, 9.3, 10.8, 12.4, 13.9, 15.5, 17.0, 18.6]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.2, 0.0, -0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0, -0.1, 0.0, 0.1, -0.1, 0.0, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5, 5.2, 5.1, 5.3, 5.2, 5.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.2, 5.3, 5.1, 5.2]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1, 1.2, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.1, 1.2]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.5, 1.3, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.4, 1.3]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.

Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: 

        Explanation: The car's average speed is within the usual range of 5 to 7 m/s, and none of the speeds exceed 7 m/s, so it is not adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s.
