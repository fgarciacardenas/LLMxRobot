The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is within acceptable limits, suggesting the car is staying on the racing line. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is constant, which is typical for a car on a straight section of the track. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also relatively low, indicating the car is not deviating significantly from the track. The distances to the left and right walls are increasing, but still within safe limits, and the car is not reversing or facing the wall.\n\nAdhering to Human: True\n\n", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 518, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 159, "model_name": "models_microsoft_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf"}

However, the distance to the left wall is consistently close (0.35 to 0.36 meters), which suggests the car is indeed driving close to the left wall. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall, which means it is safe to drive close to the left wall without compromising safety.\n\n\nAdhering to Human: True\n\n", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 474, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 130, "model_name": "models_microsoft_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf"}

However, the deviation is minimal and does not suggest a significant deviation from the centerline. The speed along the racing line is constant, and the speed perpendicular to the line is also constant, which suggests the car is maintaining a steady trajectory.

The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is minimal, suggesting the car is staying close to the racing line. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is consistent, which is ideal for maintaining a good lap time. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also consistent, indicating the car is not deviating significantly from the racing line. The distances to the walls are within safe limits, and the car is not reversing or facing the wall.\n\nAdhering to Human: True\n\n", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 472, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 152, "model_name": "models_microsoft_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf"}
