The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is minimal, suggesting the car is staying close to the racing line. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is relatively stable, and the speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also minimal, which means the car is not deviating significantly from the optimal trajectory. The distances to the walls are within safe limits, and there is no indication of the car reversing or crashing.\n\nAdhering to Human: True\n\n", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 574, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 148, "model_name": "models_microsoft_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf"}

The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is minimal, suggesting the car is staying close to the racing line. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is constant, which is ideal for maintaining a steady pace on the racing line. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also relatively low, indicating the car is not deviating significantly from the racing line. The distances to the walls are within safe limits, and there is no indication of the car reversing or crashing.\n\nAdhering to Human: True\n\n", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 487, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 159, "model_name": "models_microsoft_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf"}
