The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is present but relatively small, suggesting the car is not significantly deviating from the racing line. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is decreasing, which is typical in a race as the car approaches the finish line. The d-speed indicates the car is maintaining a consistent lateral speed, which is expected in a controlled racing scenario. The distances to the walls are within safe limits, and there is no indication of the car reversing or crashing.\n\nAdhering to Human: False\n\n", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": false, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 518, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 160, "model_name": "models_microsoft_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf"}

The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is minimal, suggesting the car is staying close to the racing line. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is relatively stable and increasing, which is optimal for maintaining a good lap time. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also minimal, indicating the car is not deviating significantly from the racing line. The distances to the walls are within safe limits, and there is no indication of the car reversing or crashing.\n\nAdhering to Human: True\n\n", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 487, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 158, "model_name": "models_microsoft_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf"}

The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is minimal, suggesting the car is staying close to the racing line. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is constant, which is ideal for maintaining a steady pace. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also constant, indicating the car is not deviating significantly from the racing line.

The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is minimal, suggesting the car is staying close to the racing line. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is constant, which is ideal for maintaining a steady pace on the racing line. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also constant, indicating the car is not deviating significantly from the racing line. The distance to the walls is constant, which implies the car is not veering towards the walls.\n\n\nAdhering to Human: True\n\n", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 487, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 154, "model_name": "models_microsoft_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf"}
