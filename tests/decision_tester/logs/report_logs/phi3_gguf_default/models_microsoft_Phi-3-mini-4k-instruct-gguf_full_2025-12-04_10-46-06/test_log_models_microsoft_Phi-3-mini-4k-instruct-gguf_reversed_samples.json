The car is not reversing, as the bool for reversing is False. The car is not facing the wall, as the bool for facing the wall is also False. However, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is increasingly negative, which suggests it is moving closer to the wall. This behavior is not ideal for optimizing lap time, but it does not indicate a crash.\n\nAdhering to Human: True\n\n", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 753, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 128, "model_name": "models_microsoft_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf"}
