However, the deviations are relatively small, suggesting that the car is close to the centerline. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is consistent, which is a good sign for maintaining a steady pace. The d-speed shows that the car is not accelerating or decelerating perpendicular to the racing line, which is also a positive sign. The distances to the walls are equal, indicating that the car is not facing either wall.\n\nAdhering to Human: False\n\n", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": false, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 755, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 158, "model_name": "models_microsoft_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf"}

The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is minimal, suggesting the car is staying close to the racing line. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is also increasing, which is desirable for optimizing lap time. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is relatively low, indicating the car is not deviating significantly from the racing line. The distances to the walls are within safe limits, and the car is not reversing or facing the wall.\n\nAdhering to Human: True\n\n", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 489, "rag_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 151, "model_name": "models_microsoft_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf"}
