The lateral deviation is also constant at 0.2 meters, suggesting it is not deviating from the racing line. The speed along the racing line is zero, which means the car is not moving forward. The speed perpendicular to the racing line is also zero, indicating no lateral movement. The distances to the left and right walls are constant, showing the car is not approaching any walls.

The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is also constant at 0.2 meters, suggesting the car is not deviating from the racing line. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is 0 meters per second, which means the car is not moving forward. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also 0 meters per second, indicating no lateral movement.

The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is 0.5 meters, which suggests the car is slightly off the centerline but still close to it. The speed along the racing line (s-speed) is 0 meters per second, which means the car is not moving forward on the track. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also 0 meters per second, indicating the car is not deviating from the centerline. The distances to the left and right walls are equal, suggesting the car is not facing the wall.

However, the lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is consistently at 0.5 meters, which means the car is not perfectly on the centerline but slightly deviating to the sides.
