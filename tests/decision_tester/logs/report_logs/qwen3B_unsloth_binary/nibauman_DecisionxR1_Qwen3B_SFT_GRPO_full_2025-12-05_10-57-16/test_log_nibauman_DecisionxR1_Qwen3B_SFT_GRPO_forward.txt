        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 15 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Test Case: Drive close to the left wall
Sample Index: 10
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive close to the left wall 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 0 seconds in 6 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, 4.8, 6]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.18, 0.16, 0.12]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 8 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 6, 6.5, 6]

        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 0.7, 1.4, 2.1, 2.8, 3.5, 4.2, 4.9, 5.6, 6.3]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.05, 0.02, -0.01, 0.03, -0.02, 0.01, 0.04, -0.03, 0.01, 0]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 6.8, 7, 6.9, 6.7, 6.5, 6.3, 6.1, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.05, 0.07, 0.02, 0.03, 0.08, 0.05, 0.06, 0.04, 0.03]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.5, 1.4, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.5]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.3, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.4]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: True
Sanitized Output: True
Expected Output: False
