        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6.5, 6.7, 6.6, 6.8, 6.7, 6.6, 6.5, 6.7, 6.8, 6.6, 6.7]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.25, 0.15, 0.2, 0.1, 0.25, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.3, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.6]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.2, 1.3, 1.2, 1.4, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.2, 1.3, 1.1]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 



    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: True
Sanitized Output: True
Expected Output: False
