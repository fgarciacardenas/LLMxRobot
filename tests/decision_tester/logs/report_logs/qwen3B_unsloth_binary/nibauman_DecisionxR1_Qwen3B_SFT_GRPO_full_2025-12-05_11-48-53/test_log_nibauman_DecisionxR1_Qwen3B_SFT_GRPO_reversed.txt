Test Case: Drive on the centerline
Sample Index: 23
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 14 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [25, 24.5, 24, 23.5, 23, 22.5, 22, 21.5, 21, 20.5, 20, 19.5, 19, 18.5]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.2, 0.1, 0.0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1.0, 1.05, 1.1, 1.15, 1.2, 1.25]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.4, 1.35, 1.3, 1.25, 1.2, 1.15, 1.1, 1.05, 1.0, 0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8, 0.75]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: True

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False
