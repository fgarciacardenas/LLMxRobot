        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 13 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34]

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently 6 m/s, which indicates it is moving at a steady pace. The d-speed is also consistently low, with values under 0.5 m/s, indicating negligible lateral movement. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of the car being close to the walls or facing them. The car is not stopped, as it is moving at a constant speed.

The d-speed is 0.1 m/s, which is negligible, suggesting the car is not oscillating significantly. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of the car being close to the walls or facing them. The human wants the car to "Don't move," which is consistent with the car's current state of steady forward motion.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is consistently at -0.3 meters, indicating a constant deviation from the racing line. The d-speed is 0.2 meters per second, which is well below the threshold of 0.5 meters per second for oscillations to be considered negligible.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is increasing from 0.1 to 0.25 meters, which is above the threshold of 0.3 meters, indicating it is not on the racing line. The distance to the left wall is decreasing from 0.35 to 0.25 meters, suggesting the car is moving closer to the left wall. However, the car is not reversing, and the human wants the car to drive close to the left wall, which is not being adhered to as the car is not maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4 meters from the wall.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is consistently at 0.34, which is below the threshold of 0.35 meters, indicating the car is not oscillating around the racing line. The car is maintaining a consistent distance from both walls, with the left and right distances being equal at 0.35 meters, which suggests the car is on the centerline. The human wants the car to drive on the centerline, and the car is adhering to this by maintaining a consistent distance from the walls.

Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.

You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 15 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.35, 0.36, 0.34, 0.37, 0.33, 0.38, 0.36, 0.35, 0.34, 0.37, 0.35, 0.33, 0.36, 0.34, 0.35]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5.5, 5.6, 5.5, 5.7, 5.5, 5.6, 5.5, 5.6, 5.5, 5.7, 5.5, 5.6, 5.5, 5.6, 5.5]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.35, 0.36, 0.34, 0.37, 0.33, 0.38, 0.36, 0.35, 0.34, 0.37, 0.35, 0.33, 0.36, 0.34, 0.35]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [3.65, 3.64, 3.66, 3.63, 3.67, 3.62, 3.64, 3.65, 3.66, 3.63, 3.65, 3.67, 3.64, 3.66, 3.65]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is consistently within the range of 0.35 to 0.38 meters, which is below the threshold of 0.3 meters, indicating the car is not oscillating around the racing line. The car's distance to the walls is also within a safe range, with the left and right distances being about equal, suggesting the car is not close to any wall. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of a crash or facing the wall. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.

Adhering to Human: True
Sanitized Output: True
Expected Output: False
