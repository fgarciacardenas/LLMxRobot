Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 8 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 36]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, -0.1, -0.1, 0.1, 0.1, -0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.4, 1.4, 1.5, 1.5, 1.4]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.4, 1.4, 1.5, 1.5, 1.4]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently 6 m/s, which indicates it is moving at a constant speed. The d-speed is also consistently 0.2-0.3 m/s, which is well below the threshold of 0.5 m/s, indicating negligible lateral movement. The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is within the range of 0.1 m, which is considered negligible. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of the car being close to a wall or facing a wall. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's command to "Don't move."

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently 6 m/s, which indicates it is moving at a steady pace. The d-speed is also consistently 0.1 m/s, which is negligible and indicates no lateral movement. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of the car being close to the walls or facing them. The car is not stopped, as it is moving at a constant speed.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 4 seconds in 10 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 0.7, 1.4, 2.1, 2.8, 3.5, 4.2, 4.9, 5.6, 6.3]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.05, 0.02, -0.01, 0.03, -0.02, 0.01, 0.04, -0.03, 0.01, 0]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 6.8, 7, 6.9, 6.7, 6.5, 6.3, 6.1, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.05, 0.07, 0.02, 0.03, 0.08, 0.05, 0.06, 0.04, 0.03]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.5, 1.4, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.5]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.3, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.4]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently close to 0 m/s, indicating that the car is effectively stopped. The d-speed is also very low, with values under 0.5 m/s, suggesting negligible lateral movement. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of the car being close to the walls or facing them. The car is not moving, which aligns with the human's desire to "Don't move."

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) oscillates between positive and negative values, but the magnitude of these oscillations is less than 0.3m, and the d-speed is under 0.5m/s. According to Hint 8, these oscillations are negligible. The car is not reversing, and it is not facing the wall. The car is not on the centerline, as the left and right distances to the walls are not equal. However, the car is not crashing, and it is not reversing, which suggests it is oscillating around the racing line.

If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is consistently below 0.3m, indicating it is not oscillating around the racing line. The distances to the left and right walls are about equal, suggesting the car is on the centerline. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of a crash or facing the wall. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's command to drive on the centerline.

Adhering to Human: True
Sanitized Output: True
Expected Output: False
