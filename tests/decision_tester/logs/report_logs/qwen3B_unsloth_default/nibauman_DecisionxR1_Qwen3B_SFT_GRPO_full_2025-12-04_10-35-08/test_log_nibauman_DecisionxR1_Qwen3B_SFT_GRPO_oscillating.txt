        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently between 5.5 m/s and 6.5 m/s, indicating it is not stopped (Hint 4). The d-speed is within the negligible oscillation range (Hint 8), and the d-coordinate oscillates around 0.4 m, which is not considered to be on the racing line (Hint 6). The car is not reversing (Hint 11) and not facing the wall (Hint 6). The car is not close to any wall (Hint 3), as the distances to the walls are above 0.4 m.

The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of the car being close to the walls. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's command to "Don't move."

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently close to 0.2m/s, which indicates the car is effectively stopped. The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) and d-speed are within acceptable limits, with no significant oscillations or deviations from the racing line. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of the car being close to a wall. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's command to "Don't move."

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) oscillates between positive and negative values, but the magnitude of these oscillations is less than 0.3m, which is considered negligible. The d-speed values are also below 0.5m/s, further indicating that the lateral oscillations are not significant. The car is not reversing, and it is not facing the wall. The car is not on the centerline, as the left and right distances to the walls are not equal. However, the car is not crashing, and it is not reversing, which aligns with the human's desire for oscillations.

Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 4:

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is within the range of 0.3m, indicating it is not significantly off the racing line. The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is within a small range, suggesting it is not oscillating significantly. The distances to the walls are not consistently below 0.4m, indicating the car is not close to either wall. Given the car's position and speed, it is not reversing and not facing the wall, and it is not crashing. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's desire to drive on the centerline.

Test Case: Drive on the centerline
Sample Index: 17
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 14 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5, 15, 15.5, 16, 16.5]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.3, -0.4, 0.5, -0.5, 0.4, -0.3, 0.5, -0.4, 0.4, -0.5, 0.5, -0.4, 0.3, -0.3]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5.5, 6, 5.8, 6.2, 5.9, 5.7, 6.1, 5.8, 6, 5.9, 6.2, 5.8, 6, 5.9]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 0.9, 0.8, 1, 0.9, 0.8, 1, 0.9, 1, 0.9]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [0.9, 1, 0.9, 1, 0.8, 1, 0.9, 0.8, 1, 0.9, 1, 0.8, 0.9, 1]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is within the range of 0.3 to 0.7 meters, which is not considered to be on the centerline. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, and the car is not maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4 meters from either wall. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's desire to drive on the centerline.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is within the range of 0.3m, which is considered not to be on the racing line. The distances to the left and right walls are nearly equal, indicating the car is not on the centerline. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of the car being close to a wall or oscillating around the racing line. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's command to drive on the centerline.

        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 6 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.4, -0.5, 0.6, -0.7, 0.8, -0.9]

        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speeds are 6, 6.5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, and 5.5 m/s, which are all below the human's desired speed of 3 m/s. The average s-speed is (6 + 6.5 + 5.5 + 6 + 6.5 + 5.5) / 6 = 5.83 m/s, which is not faster than 3 m/s.
