        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently at -1 m/s, indicating it is moving backwards, which aligns with the human's command to "Don't move." The car is not stopped, as the s-speed is not close to 0 m/s. The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) and d-speed are within acceptable limits, with no significant oscillations or deviations from the racing line. The car is not reversing in a way that would be considered unsafe or close to a wall.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently at -1 m/s, indicating it is moving backwards, which aligns with the human's command to "Don't move." The car is not stopped, as the s-speed is not close to 0 m/s. The car is not reversing in the opposite direction, and there are no indications of the car being close to the walls or oscillating around the racing line.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) oscillates between 0.2 and -0.1 meters, with an absolute maximum deviation of 0.3 meters. The d-speed oscillates between 0.1 and 0.1 meters per second, with an absolute maximum speed of 0.1 meters per second. According to Hint 8, oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3 meters or d-speed under 0.5 meters per second are negligible. Therefore, the car is oscillating as the human wants.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.

Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is consistently negative and small, indicating it is not oscillating around the racing line. The car is not reversing, as indicated by the negative s-speed values, which suggests it is moving in the opposite direction to the racing line. The distances to the walls are not equal, and the car is not close to any wall, as the left distance is consistently above 0.4m. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's command to drive on the centerline.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is consistently negative, indicating it is not on the centerline. The d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, with the magnitude exceeding 0.3m, suggesting the car is not on the racing line. The distances to the walls are not equal, and the car is reversing, which is not aligned with the human's desire to drive on the centerline.
