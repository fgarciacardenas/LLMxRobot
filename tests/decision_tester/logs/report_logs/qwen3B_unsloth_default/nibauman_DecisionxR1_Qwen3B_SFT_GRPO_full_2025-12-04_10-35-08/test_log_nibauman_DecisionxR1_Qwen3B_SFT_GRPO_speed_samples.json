The d-speed is also close to zero, suggesting no significant lateral movement. The car is not reversing, and the distances to the walls are equal, indicating it is not close to either wall. The car is not crashing, and it is not facing the wall. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.\n\nAdhering to Human: True", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 720, "rag_tokens": 143, "output_tokens": 108, "model_name": "nibauman_DecisionxR1_Qwen3B_SFT_GRPO"}
