Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 11 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed and d-speed are both 0, indicating that the car is not moving. The car is not reversing, crashed, or facing the wall. The car is not adhering to the human's command to "Don't move" because it is not stopped, but it is not moving either, which aligns with the human's desire to be still.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-coordinate and d-coordinate remain constant at 10 and 0.5, respectively, indicating it is not moving along the racing line. The car's s-speed and d-speed are all 0, suggesting it is stopped. The distance to the left wall is consistently 0.3m, which is below the 0.4m threshold, indicating the car is close to the left wall. Since the car is not moving and is close to the left wall, it is adhering to the human's desire to drive close to the left wall.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-coordinate and d-coordinate remain constant at 5.0, indicating it is not moving along the racing line. The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is consistently 0.1, which is below the threshold of 0.3m, suggesting it is not oscillating around the racing line. The distances to the walls are equal at 0.6m, indicating the car is not on the centerline. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of a crash or facing the wall.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-coordinate remains constant at 15, indicating it is not moving along the racing line. The d-coordinate is consistently 0.1, which is below the threshold of 0.3m, suggesting the car is not deviating significantly from the racing line.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-coordinate and d-coordinate remain constant at 100 and 0.2, respectively, indicating it is not moving along the racing line. The car is not on the centerline as the left and right distances to the walls are not equal, and the car is not reversing or crashed. The car is not facing the wall, and the d-speed is 0, indicating no lateral movement.
