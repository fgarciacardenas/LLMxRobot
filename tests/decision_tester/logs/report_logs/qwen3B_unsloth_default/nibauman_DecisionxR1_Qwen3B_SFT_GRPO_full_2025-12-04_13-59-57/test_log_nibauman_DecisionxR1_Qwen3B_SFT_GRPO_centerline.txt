Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) oscillates between positive and negative values, with the magnitude of oscillation being larger than 0.3 meters. The d-speed is also oscillating, but within the range of 0.1 to 0.5 meters per second, which is considered negligible according to Hint 8. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is consistently positive and increasing, and the s-coordinate is increasing over time. The car is not facing the wall, and there is no indication of a crash. Therefore, the car is oscillating as per the human's command.

Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently on the centerline as the left and right distances to the walls are equal at 1.2 meters. The car is not reversing, and the human wants the car to drive close to the left wall. The car is not facing the wall, and there is no indication of a crash. The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is consistent, and the d-speed is 0, which means the car is not moving laterally. The car's s-speed is 6 m/s, which is not close to 0 m/s, indicating the car is moving forward. Since the car is not reversing and is not facing the wall, it is adhering to the human's desire to drive close to the left wall.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-coordinate remains constant at 6 meters, indicating it is not moving along the racing line. The d-coordinate is consistently 0, and the d-speed is 0, suggesting the car is not deviating from the racing line. However, the car is not adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line as it is not moving along the racing line's trajectory.
