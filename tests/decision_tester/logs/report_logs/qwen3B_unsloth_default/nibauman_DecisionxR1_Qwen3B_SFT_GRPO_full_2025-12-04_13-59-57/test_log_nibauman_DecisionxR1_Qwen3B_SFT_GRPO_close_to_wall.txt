Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

The d-speed values are within the range of 0.1 to 0.2 meters per second, which is negligible according to Hint 8. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is consistently positive and increasing, and the s-coordinate is increasing over time. The car is not facing the wall, and there is no indication of a crash.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) oscillates between positive and negative values, with the magnitude of oscillation being 0.35 to 0.15 meters, which is within the threshold of 0.3 meters as per Hint 7. The d-speed values are within the range of 0.15 to 0.5 meters per second, which is considered negligible as per Hint 8. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is consistently positive and increasing, and the s-coordinate is increasing over time. The car is not facing the wall, and it has not crashed. Therefore, the car is oscillating as per the human's command.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is consistently around 0.33 to 0.35 meters, which is within the acceptable range for a minimal curvature trajectory. The d-speed is very low, indicating minimal lateral movement, and the car is not oscillating around the racing line. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is mostly between 5.5 and 5.6 m/s, which is within the typical range for forward driving. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is positive and increasing, and the s-coordinates are increasing. The car is not facing the wall, and there is no indication of a crash.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-coordinate remains constant at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 meters, indicating it is driving along the racing line without deviation. The d-coordinate is consistently negative, but the magnitude of the deviation is small (less than 0.3 meters), and the d-speed is negligible, suggesting the car is not oscillating around the racing line. The car's speed is consistent at 6 m/s, which is within the normal range of 5 to 7 m/s. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall.

Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is consistently positive and does not oscillate between positive and negative values with a magnitude larger than 0.3 meters. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is within the typical range of 5 to 7 m/s, and it is increasing, indicating forward motion. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is not negative, and the s-coordinate is increasing. The car is not facing the wall, and there is no indication of a crash. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 8 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [-0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3, -0.3]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-coordinate remains constant at 10-17 meters, indicating it is not moving along the racing line. The d-coordinate is consistently -0.3, and the d-speed is 0, suggesting the car is not oscillating around the racing line. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is 6 m/s, which is within the normal range of 5-7 m/s. However, the car is not adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is consistently within a small range and does not oscillate significantly, indicating it is not oscillating around the racing line. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is within the typical range of 5 to 7 m/s, and it is not reversing (s-coordinate is increasing, and s-speed is positive). The car is not reversing, and it is not facing the wall. The car is not crashing, and the distances to the walls are within safe limits. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.
