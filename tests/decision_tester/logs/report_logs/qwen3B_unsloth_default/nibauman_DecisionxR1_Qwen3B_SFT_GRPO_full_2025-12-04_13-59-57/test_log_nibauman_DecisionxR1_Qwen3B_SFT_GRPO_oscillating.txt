Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive close to the left wall 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 4 seconds in 5 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1.5, 3.1, 4.6, 6.2]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.2, -0.4, 0.3, -0.5, 0.4]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5.5, 6.0, 5.8, 6.2, 5.9]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.7, 0.8]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.2, 1.1, 1.3, 1.0, 1.1]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.3, 1.4, 1.2, 1.5, 1.4]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.

The human wants the car to drive on the centerline, and the car is not reversing or facing the wall. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is within a reasonable range, and the human's speed requirement is not explicitly set, so the car is driving at a speed between 5 and 7 m/s, which is consistent with the human's desire to drive on the centerline.

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 6 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.4, -0.4, 0.5, -0.5, 0.6, -0.6]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.7, -0.7, 0.8, -0.8, 0.9, -0.9]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1, 1.5, 1, 1.5, 1, 1.5]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.5, 1, 1.5, 1, 1.5, 1]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently on the centerline as the left and right distances to the walls are about equal (1.5m and 1.5m, respectively). The human wants the car to drive on the centerline, and the car is not reversing or crashed, indicating it is adhering to the human's command.

Adhering to Human: True

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive faster than 3 m/s 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second.

        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speeds are [6, 6.5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 5.5], which are all below 3 m/s. The human wants the car to drive faster than 3 m/s, but the current s-speeds indicate that the car is not adhering to this requirement.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False>
