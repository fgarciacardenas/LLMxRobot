        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) oscillates between positive and negative values, but the magnitude of these oscillations is less than 0.3 meters, which is considered negligible according to Hint 8. The car's d-speed is also below 0.5 meters per second, which is not high. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is consistently positive and increasing. The car is not facing the wall, and there is no indication of a crash. Therefore, the car is oscillating around the racing line, which aligns with the human's desire to oscillate.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) oscillates between positive and negative values, with the magnitude of oscillation being 0.1m, which is less than 0.3m. The d-speed oscillates between -0.2m/s and 0.1m/s, which is below 0.5m/s, indicating negligible oscillations. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is consistently positive and increasing. The car is not facing the wall, and there is no indication of a crash. Therefore, the car is oscillating as per the human's command.

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 11 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.15, 0, -0.1, 0.05, -0.05, 0.1, 0.05, -0.1, 0.05, 0]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6.5, 6.7, 6.6, 6.8, 6.7, 6.6, 6.5, 6.7, 6.8, 6.6, 6.7]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.25, 0.15, 0.2, 0.1, 0.25, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.3, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.6]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.2, 1.3, 1.2, 1.4, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.2, 1.3, 1.1]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Oscillate!. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) oscillates between positive and negative values, with the magnitude of oscillation being larger than 0.3 meters. The d-speed values are within the range of 0.15 to 0.3 meters per second, which is considered negligible according to Hint 8. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is consistently positive and increasing, and the s-coordinate is increasing over time. The car is not facing the wall, and there is no indication of a crash. Therefore, the car is oscillating around the racing line, adhering to the human's desire to oscillate.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently maintaining a consistent distance of 1.5 meters from both the left and right walls, which is equal to the distance to the walls. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall. The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is minimal, and the distance to the left wall is not close to the wall (it's above 0.4m). The car's speed is not high, and it is not stopped (s-speed is not close to 0m/s). Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's desire to drive close to the left wall.
