        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 11 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [50, 49.5, 49, 48.5, 48, 47.5, 47, 46.5, 46, 45.5, 45]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0, -0.05, -0.1, -0.15, -0.2, -0.25]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0, -0.05, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1, -0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Don't move. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently at -1 m/s, indicating it is moving at a constant speed, which aligns with the human's desire to "Don't move." The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of the car being stopped or crashed. The car is not close to the walls, as the distances to both walls are 1 meter, which is above the 0.4m threshold for being close to a wall.

You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently at -1 m/s, indicating it is moving backwards, which aligns with the human's command to "Don't move." The car is not stopped, as the s-speed is not close to 0 m/s, but it is moving in the opposite direction of the racing line, adhering to the human's command to maintain a consistent position without advancing or reversing forward.

If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.

        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently reversing, which is not in line with the human's desire to drive on the centerline. The s-speed is consistently negative, indicating the car is moving backwards, and the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples, further confirming the reversal. The car is not on the centerline as the left and right distances to the walls are not equal.

Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently reversing, which is not aligned with the human's desire to drive on the centerline. The s-speed is consistently negative, indicating the car is moving in the opposite direction of the racing line. Additionally, the lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is not centered, as it starts from a positive value and decreases, suggesting the car is not on the centerline. The car is not facing the wall, but it is reversing, which is not in line with the human's command to drive on the centerline.
