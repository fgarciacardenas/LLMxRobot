Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Hint 2:

Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is negative, indicating that the car is reversing. The human wants the car to reverse, and the car's s-speed is consistent with reversing. The car is not stopped, as the s-speed is not close to 0m/s. The car is not reversing due to the racing line's minimal curvature, but the human's command to reverse overrides this.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) oscillates between positive and negative values, with the magnitude of oscillation being 0.3 meters, which is within the threshold of 0.3 meters as per Hint 8. The d-speed values are also within the acceptable range of 0.5 meters per second, indicating that the lateral oscillations are not significant. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is consistently positive, and there are no indications of the car facing the wall or having crashed.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) oscillates between positive and negative values, with the magnitude of oscillation being 0.3 meters, which is within the threshold of 0.3 meters as per Hint 8. The d-speed values are also within the acceptable range of 0.5 meters per second, indicating that the lateral oscillations are not significant. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is consistently positive, and there are no indications of the car facing the wall or having crashed.

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) oscillates between positive and negative values, with the magnitude of oscillation being larger than 0.3 meters. The d-speed is also oscillating, but within the range of 0.1 to 0.3 meters per second, which is considered negligible. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is consistently positive and increasing, and the s-coordinate is increasing over time. The car is not facing the wall, and there is no indication of a crash. Therefore, the car is oscillating around the racing line as desired by the human.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 9 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, -0.1, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1, -0.1, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5, 5.5, 6, 5.8, 6.2, 5.7, 5.9, 6.1, 5.5]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.4, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.6]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.4, 1.5, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.3]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently on the centerline as the left and right distances to the walls are about equal, with both distances being approximately 1.4 to 1.6 meters. The human wants the car to drive on the centerline, and the car is not reversing or facing the wall. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is within a small range, indicating it is not deviating significantly from the centerline.

Adhering to Human: True
Sanitized Output: True
Expected Output: False

Test Case: Drive faster than 3 m/s

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive faster than 3 m/s 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 13 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0.0, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, 3.0, 3.6, 4.2, 4.8, 5.4, 6.0, 6.6, 7.2]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.05, -0.05, -0.1, 0.0, 0.05, -0.05, 0.1, 0.0, -0.05, 0.05, 0.1, -0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.2, 0.15, 0.3]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently 3.5 m/s, which is below the human's desired speed of 3 m/s. The car is not adhering to the human's requirement to drive faster than 3 m/s.
