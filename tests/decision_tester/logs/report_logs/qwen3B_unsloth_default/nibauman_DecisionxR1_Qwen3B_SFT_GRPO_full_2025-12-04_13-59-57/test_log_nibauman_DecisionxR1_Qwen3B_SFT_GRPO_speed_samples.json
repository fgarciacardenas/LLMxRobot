The car is not reversing, crashed, or facing the wall, and the speed is within the typical range of 5 to 7 m/s. \n\nAdhering to Human: True", "structure_followed": true, "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 604, "rag_tokens": 134, "output_tokens": 134, "model_name": "nibauman_DecisionxR1_Qwen3B_SFT_GRPO"}

The s-speed is mostly within the range of 5 to 7 m/s, which is consistent with the human's desire to drive at a forward speed. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is positive and increasing, and the s-coordinate is increasing over time. The car is not facing the wall, and there is no indication of a crash.
