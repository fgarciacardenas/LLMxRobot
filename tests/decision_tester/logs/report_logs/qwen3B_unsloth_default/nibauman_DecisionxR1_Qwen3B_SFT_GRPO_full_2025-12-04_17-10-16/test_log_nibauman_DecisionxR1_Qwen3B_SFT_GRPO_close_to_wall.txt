        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently close to 0.56 m/s, which is very slow and indicates that the car is not moving significantly. The d-speed is also very low, suggesting minimal lateral movement. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of crashing or facing the wall. The human's command to "Don't move" is being adhered to as the car is essentially stationary.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently below 5.8 m/s, which is significantly lower than the typical speed of an autonomous racing car. The d-speed is also very low, indicating minimal lateral movement. The car is not reversing, and there are no indications of a crash or facing the wall. The human's command to "Don't move" is being adhered to as the car is not actively driving or accelerating.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is consistently increasing, indicating it is moving away from the left wall. The distance to the left wall is decreasing, suggesting the car is moving closer to the wall. However, the car is not adhering to the human's desire to drive close to the left wall, as it is not maintaining a consistent position closer to the wall.
