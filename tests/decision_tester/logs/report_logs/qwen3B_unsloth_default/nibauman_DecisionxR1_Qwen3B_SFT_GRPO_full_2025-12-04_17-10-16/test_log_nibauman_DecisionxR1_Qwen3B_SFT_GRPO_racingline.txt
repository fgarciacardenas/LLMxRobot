Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is consistently between 0.1 and 0.2 meters, which is within the acceptable range for centerline driving. The d-speed values are small, indicating minimal lateral movement, suggesting the car is not deviating significantly from the racing line. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is increasing slightly, but it remains within a reasonable range for forward motion. The distances to the walls are within safe limits, and the car is not reversing or facing a wall.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently below the racing line's speed, indicating it is not maintaining the optimal racing line trajectory. The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is not zero, suggesting the car is not perfectly aligned with the racing line. The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is not zero, which implies the car is not moving purely along the racing line. 

Adhering to Human: False
Sanitized Output: False

Test Case: Drive on the racing line
Sample Index: 22
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 14 samples.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently decreasing, indicating it is not accelerating or moving forward at a constant speed, which suggests it is not adhering to the racing line. The d-speed is also decreasing, indicating the car is not moving perpendicular to the racing line. The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is not zero, and the distances to the walls are not constant, suggesting the car is not on a minimal curvature trajectory. 

Adhering to Human: False
