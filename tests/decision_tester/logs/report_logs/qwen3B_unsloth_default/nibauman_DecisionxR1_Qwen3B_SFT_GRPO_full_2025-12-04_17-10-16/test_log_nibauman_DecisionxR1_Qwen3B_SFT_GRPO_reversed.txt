        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently negative, indicating it is moving backwards, which aligns with the human's command to "Don't move." The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) and d-speed are minimal, suggesting the car is not deviating significantly from the racing line. The car is not reversing, crashing, or facing the wall, and the distances to the walls are within safe limits.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently negative, indicating it is reversing, which is not aligned with the human's desire to drive on the centerline. The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is not centered around the racing line, as it oscillates between positive and negative values, suggesting it is not maintaining a consistent position on the centerline.
