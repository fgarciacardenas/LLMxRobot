        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive close to the left wall 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 13 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34]

        - The distance to the right wall is: [2.65, 2.7, 2.75, 2.65, 2.6, 2.55, 2.5, 2.45, 2.5, 2.55, 2.6, 2.65, 2.7]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive close to the left wall. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate, which indicates lateral deviation from the racing line, is consistently positive and above 0.2m, indicating it is not driving close to the left wall. The human wants the car to drive close to the left wall, but the car's lateral deviation suggests it is maintaining a distance from the left wall, not adhering to the human's command.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is consistently around 0.35-0.38 meters, which is not close to the left wall (0.35 meters or less). The car is maintaining a distance from the left wall that is not close to it, as per the human's request.

If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently 6 m/s, which is above the human's desired speed of 3 m/s. However, the human specifically requested to drive "faster than 3 m/s," and the car is not exceeding the human's desired speed. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's command to drive faster than 3 m/s.

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: True

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate remains within the range of -0.35 to -0.38, which is below the 0.3m threshold, indicating that the car is staying on the racing line. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall, all of which align with the human's desire to drive on the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate is consistently around -0.3, which is above 0.3m, indicating that the car is not on the racing line. Additionally, the car is not oscillating around the racing line as the d-coordinate does not change significantly. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate increases from 0.1 to 0.2, indicating it is deviating from the racing line. The d-speed is also increasing, suggesting the car is moving away from the racing line. Additionally, the car is not on the centerline as the distances to the left and right walls are not equal. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.
