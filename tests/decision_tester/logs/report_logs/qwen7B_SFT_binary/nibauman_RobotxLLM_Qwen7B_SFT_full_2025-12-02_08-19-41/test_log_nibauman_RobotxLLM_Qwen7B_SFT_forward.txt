        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, indicating it is oscillating around the racing line. The d-coordinate should ideally be close to 0.0 to be on the centerline. Additionally, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is not consistently close to 0.0, which suggests it is not driving on the centerline as desired.

        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) oscillates between positive and negative values, indicating that the car is not driving on the centerline. The d-coordinate values exceed 0.3m, which is considered not to be on the racing line. Additionally, the car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall, but these conditions do not address the primary concern of being on the centerline.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second.

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate remains consistently at 0.1m, which is below the 0.3m threshold, indicating it is not oscillating around the racing line. However, the d-coordinate is not close to 0.0m, which would indicate being on the centerline. Additionally, the car is maintaining a consistent distance from both walls, but it is not driving on the centerline as the human desires.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, indicating that it is oscillating around the racing line. The oscillation exceeds 0.3 meters, which is not ideal for maintaining a stable trajectory. Additionally, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is not consistent, as it fluctuates between positive and negative values. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between 0.1 and 0.2, which is within the threshold of 0.3m, indicating it is not significantly deviating from the racing line. However, the car's lateral deviation is not consistent, suggesting it is not driving on the racing line as expected. Additionally, the car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall, which are all positive indicators. Nonetheless, the oscillation in d-coordinate suggests the car is not adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.

Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, with a maximum deviation of 0.2 meters from the racing line. This oscillation is within the threshold of 0.3 meters, but it indicates that the car is not driving on the exact racing line. Additionally, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is not consistently close to zero, which suggests it is not adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, indicating it is not driving on the racing line. The d-coordinate exceeds 0.3m, which is considered not to be on the racing line.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 13 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60]

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, indicating it is oscillating around the racing line. The oscillation exceeds 0.3 meters, which is not ideal for maintaining a stable position on the racing line. Additionally, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is not consistently close to zero, suggesting it is not driving on the racing line as desired.

Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between 0.1 and 0.2, which is within the threshold of 0.3m, indicating it is not significantly deviating from the racing line. However, the car's d-speed is not zero, suggesting it is not maintaining a stable position relative to the racing line. Additionally, the car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall, but these factors do not directly address the primary concern of adhering to the racing line. Therefore, the car is not strictly adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.
