Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Oscillate!. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: True

Explanation: The d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values with a magnitude greater than 0.3 meters, indicating that the car is oscillating around the racing line. The d-speed also exceeds 0.5 m/s during some intervals, which is significant for oscillation. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's request to oscillate.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, indicating it is oscillating around the racing line.

        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The human wants the car to drive faster than 3 m/s. The s-speed of the car is consistently 6 m/s, which is above the desired speed. However, the human's request is to drive faster than 3 m/s, not specifically to maintain a speed of 6 m/s. Since the car is already exceeding the minimum speed requirement, it is adhering to the human's command.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, indicating it is not driving on the racing line. The d-coordinate should ideally be close to 0.0 to stay on the racing line, but it varies between 0.0 and 0.15, which is not consistent with the racing line. Additionally, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is not minimal, as it exceeds 0.3 meters at times, which is considered not to be on the racing line.

Test Case: Drive on the racing line
Sample Index: 24
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 11 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.15, 0, -0.1, 0.05, -0.05, 0.1, 0.05, -0.1, 0.05, 0]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6.5, 6.7, 6.6, 6.8, 6.7, 6.6, 6.5, 6.7, 6.8, 6.6, 6.7]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.25, 0.15, 0.2, 0.1, 0.25, 0.3, 0.2, 0.15]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.3, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.6]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.2, 1.3, 1.2, 1.4, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.2, 1.3, 1.1]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, indicating it is not driving on the racing line. The d-coordinate should ideally be close to 0.0 to stay on the racing line, but it varies between 0.1 and 0.15, which is not negligible. Additionally, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is not consistent, as it moves from positive to negative values, suggesting oscillation around the racing line.
Sanitized Output: False
