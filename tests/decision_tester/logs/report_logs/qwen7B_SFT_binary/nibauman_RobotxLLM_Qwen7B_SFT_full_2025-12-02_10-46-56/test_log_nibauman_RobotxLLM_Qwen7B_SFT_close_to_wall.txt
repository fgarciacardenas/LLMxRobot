        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive close to the left wall. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The human wants the car to drive close to the left wall. However, the distance to the left wall is consistently above 0.4 meters, which is not considered close to the wall according to the provided guidelines. The car is maintaining a safe distance from the left wall, which does not meet the human's request.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The human wants the car to drive close to the left wall. However, the distance to the left wall is consistently above 0.4 meters, which is not considered close to the wall according to the provided hints. The car is maintaining a safe distance from the wall, which does not align with the human's request.

Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently 6 m/s, which is above the human's desired speed of 3 m/s. However, the human specifically requested to drive faster than 3 m/s, and the car is already exceeding this speed. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's request.

Explanation: The human wants the car to drive faster than 3 m/s. The s-speed values provided are [6, 6.5, 6.7, 6.5, 6.2], which are all above 3 m/s. However, the average s-speed is (6 + 6.5 + 6.7 + 6.5 + 6.2) / 5 = 6.26 m/s, which is slightly above 3 m/s but not significantly so. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's desire to drive faster than 3 m/s.

Test Case: Drive on the racing line
Sample Index: 21
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 12 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.35, 0.36, 0.37, 0.38, 0.39, 0.38, 0.37, 0.36, 0.35, 0.34, 0.33, 0.32]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 6.7, 6.8, 7, 6.9, 6.8, 6.7, 6.5, 6.3, 6, 5.8]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.15, 0.15, 0.2, 0.2, 0.15, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.35, 0.34, 0.33, 0.32, 0.31, 0.32, 0.33, 0.34, 0.35, 0.36, 0.37, 0.38]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [3.65, 3.66, 3.67, 3.68, 3.69, 3.68, 3.67, 3.66, 3.65, 3.64, 3.63, 3.62]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: True

Explanation: The car is maintaining a consistent lateral deviation (d-coordinate) around 0.35-0.38 meters, which is within a safe range. The s-speed is mostly positive, indicating forward movement, and the car is not reversing or oscillating significantly. The car is not facing the wall, and it is not crashed. The car is adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: True

Explanation: The car is maintaining a consistent s-speed within the typical range of 5 to 7 m/s, and the d-coordinate oscillations are within a manageable range, indicating that the car is driving close to the racing line. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall, all of which align with the human's command to drive on the racing line.
