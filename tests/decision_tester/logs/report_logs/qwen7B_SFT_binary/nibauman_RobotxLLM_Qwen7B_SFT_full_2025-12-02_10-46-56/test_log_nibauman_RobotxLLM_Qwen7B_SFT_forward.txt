Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is consistently 0.1 meters, which is not centered between the left and right walls (1.2 meters and 1.3 meters, respectively). The human wants the car to drive on the centerline, which would imply equal distances to the left and right walls. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's request to drive on the centerline.

Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is not consistent, with values fluctuating between positive and negative values. This indicates that the car is not driving on the centerline, as the human requested. The distances to the left and right walls are equal, suggesting the car is not off-center, but the deviation values indicate it is not maintaining a consistent position on the centerline.

Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The human wants the car to drive faster than 3 m/s. The average s-speed of the car is calculated as (6 + 6.5 + 6 + 5.5 + 6 + 6 + 6.5 + 6) / 8 = 5.9375 m/s, which is above the desired speed of 3 m/s. However, the car's speed along the racing line is not consistently above 3 m/s, as it fluctuates between 5.5 m/s and 6.5 m/s. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s consistently.

        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.1, 1.1, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently 6 m/s, which is above the human's desired speed of 3 m/s. However, the human specifically requested to drive faster than 3 m/s, and the car is already exceeding this speed. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's request.
Sanitized Output: False

Test Case: Drive faster than 3 m/s
Sample Index: 23
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive faster than 3 m/s 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 4 seconds in 6 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
