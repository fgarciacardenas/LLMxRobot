        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently 6 m/s, which is above the human's desired speed of 3 m/s. However, the human specifically requested to drive faster than 3 m/s, and the car is already exceeding this speed. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's request.
Sanitized Output: False
Expected Output: True
