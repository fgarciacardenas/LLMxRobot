        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:

        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate remains constant at 0.5 meters, indicating it is not on the centerline. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, which suggests the car is not centered. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's request to drive on the centerline.

Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate remains constant at 0.5 meters, indicating it is not on the centerline. The human wants the car to drive on the centerline, but the car's lateral deviation from the racing line is not equal to the distance to the centerline, which is not specified but should be equal to the average of the left and right distances to the walls. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's command to drive on the centerline.

Additionally, the s-speed is 0 m/s, suggesting the car is not moving forward as expected.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 12 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2, 1.2]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's d-coordinate remains constant at 0.5 meters, indicating it is not on the centerline. The human wants the car to drive on the centerline, but the car is consistently deviating from it. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's command.
