Explanation: The human wants the car to drive on the centerline, but the d-coordinate (lateral deviation from the racing line) shows significant fluctuations, indicating that the car is not maintaining a consistent position along the centerline. The d-speed also indicates that the car is oscillating around the centerline, which is not ideal for driving on the centerline.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive faster than 3 m/s 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 15 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 22.5, 25, 27.5, 30, 32.5, 35]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.05, -0.05, -0.1, -0.05, 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.05, -0.05, -0.1, -0.05, 0, 0.05, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0, -0.1, -0.2]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 



    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's s-speed is consistently 6 m/s, which is above the human's desired speed of 3 m/s. However, the human specifically requested to drive "faster than 3 m/s," and the car is maintaining a constant speed of 6 m/s, which is not strictly "faster than 3 m/s" in the context of increasing speed. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's exact wording of driving "faster than 3 m/s."

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to Human: False

Explanation: The car's s-speed values are consistently between 4 m/s and 6 m/s, which is above the human's desired speed of 3 m/s. However, the human specifically requested to drive "faster than 3 m/s," and the car's speed is not significantly exceeding this threshold. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's exact request to drive faster than 3 m/s.
