        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 14 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0, 0.05, -0.1, 0.1, -0.05, 0, 0.1, -0.1, 0.05, 0, -0.05, 0.1, -0.1, 0.05]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 6.5]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0.1, -0.2, 0.2, -0.1, 0, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1, 0, -0.1, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Oscillate!. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values with a magnitude greater than 0.3 meters, indicating oscillations around the racing line. The d-speed also shows oscillations, with values exceeding 0.5 m/s. These oscillations are significant and align with the human's request to oscillate.

Model Response: Explanation: The d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with a magnitude of 0.05 to 0.03, which is below the threshold of 0.3m for significant oscillation. The d-speed also oscillates but remains below the threshold of 0.5m/s for significant oscillation. Therefore, the car is oscillating as desired by the human.
