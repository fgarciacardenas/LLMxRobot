Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate is consistently negative and decreases from -0.3 to 0.05, indicating it is not on the racing line. The car is driving forwards as it should, but it is not maintaining a consistent position along the racing line. The distances to the walls are not equal, and the car is not close to the centerline.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 7 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [-0.35, -0.36, -0.37, -0.38, -0.39, -0.39, -0.39]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.35, 0.34, 0.33, 0.32, 0.31, 0.31, 0.31]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [3.65, 3.66, 3.67, 3.68, 3.69, 3.69, 3.69]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate is consistently negative and below 0.3m, indicating it is not oscillating around the racing line. The car is maintaining a consistent distance from the left wall, which is not too close (less than 0.4m). The car is driving forwards as expected, and the s-speed is constant, indicating steady progress along the racing line.

The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, indicating the car is not on the centerline. However, the car is not too close to any wall, as the distances are above 0.4 meters.
