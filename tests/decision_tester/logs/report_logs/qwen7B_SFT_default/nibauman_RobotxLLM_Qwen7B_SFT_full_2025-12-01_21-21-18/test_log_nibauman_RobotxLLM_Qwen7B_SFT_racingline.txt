Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 10:

If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between 0.1 and 0.2, which is within the acceptable range of 0.3m or less, indicating that the car is not oscillating around the racing line. The distances to the left and right walls are approximately equal, suggesting that the car is driving on the centerline. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall, all of which are consistent with the human's desire to drive on the centerline.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate values are within the range of -0.3m to 0.3m, indicating that the car is not oscillating around the racing line. The car's s-speed is consistently close to 6.6 m/s, which is within a reasonable range for maintaining a steady speed along the racing line. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, but they are not too close to the walls, which suggests the car is not adhering to the centerline as per Hint 7.

Test Case: Drive on the racing line

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 6 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.1, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.5, 6.0]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.3]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.7]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format:

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate is increasing from 0.1 to 0.15, which is above the 0.3m threshold, indicating it is not on the racing line. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is increasing, and the d-speed is also increasing, suggesting oscillations around the racing line. The car is not facing the wall, and it is not reversing, but it is not adhering to the human's command to drive on the racing line.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, indicating it is oscillating around the racing line. The oscillation magnitude is within the acceptable range (less than 0.3m), but it is not adhering to the human's desire to drive on the racing line consistently. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is not stable, and the car is not maintaining a consistent position along the racing line.
