Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between 0.1 and 0.2, which is below the 0.3m threshold, indicating that the car is not oscillating around the racing line. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, but they are close to each other, suggesting the car is driving near the centerline. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall, which are all positive indicators.

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, indicating it is oscillating around the racing line. The oscillation magnitude is within the acceptable range (0.3m) but is not centered on the racing line. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is not consistently close to zero, which suggests it is not driving on the centerline.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, indicating it is oscillating around the racing line. The oscillation is within a small range, but it is not adhering to the racing line as it should be maintained within a consistent d-coordinate. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall, but the oscillation suggests it is not driving on the racing line as expected.
