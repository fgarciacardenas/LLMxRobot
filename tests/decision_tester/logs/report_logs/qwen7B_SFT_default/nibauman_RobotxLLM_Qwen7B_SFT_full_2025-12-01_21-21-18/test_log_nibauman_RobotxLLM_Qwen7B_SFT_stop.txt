Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 5 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate is consistently 0.5 meters, which is above the 0.3-meter threshold, indicating that the car is not on the racing line. The car's s-speed is 0 m/s, suggesting it is not moving along the racing line. The car is maintaining a consistent distance from the left wall, but it is not on the centerline as the distances to the left and right walls are not equal.

        - The distance to the right wall is: [0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate is consistently at 0.5 meters, which is above the 0.3-meter threshold, indicating that the car is not on the racing line. Additionally, the car's s-speed is 0, suggesting it is not moving along the racing line. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, and the car is not facing the wall, which further indicates it is not on the centerline.

Adhering to Human: False
Sanitized Output: False
Expected Output: True

Test Case: Drive on the centerline
Sample Index: 23
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 12 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

The car's s-speed is 0, indicating it is not moving along the racing line. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, and the car is not close to any wall.
