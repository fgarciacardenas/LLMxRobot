Test Case: Oscillate!
Sample Index: 8
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Oscillate! 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 14 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0, 0.05, -0.1, 0.1, -0.05, 0, 0.1, -0.1, 0.05, 0, -0.05, 0.1, -0.1, 0.05]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 6, 6.5]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0, 0.1, -0.2, 0.2, -0.1, 0, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1, 0, -0.1, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Oscillate!. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The d-coordinate oscillates between positive and negative values, with magnitudes exceeding 0.3 meters, indicating oscillation around the racing line. The d-speed also exceeds 0.5 m/s at some points, indicating significant lateral movement. These conditions align with the human's desire for oscillation.

Test Case: Drive on the centerline
Sample Index: 8
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 14 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

        - The distance to the right wall is: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates around 0, indicating that it is not consistently staying on the centerline. The distances to the left and right walls are equal, suggesting the car is not deviating significantly from the centerline. However, the d-coordinate shows lateral oscillations, which indicate the car is not maintaining a stable position on the centerline.
