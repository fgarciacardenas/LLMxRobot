        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate remains constant at 0.35 to 0.36 meters, indicating it is maintaining a consistent lateral deviation from the racing line. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, but they are close, suggesting the car is not significantly deviating from the centerline. The car is not reversing, as the s-speed is positive, and it has not crashed or faced the wall.

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 12 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.35, 0.36, 0.37, 0.38, 0.39, 0.38, 0.37, 0.36, 0.35, 0.34, 0.33, 0.32]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.5, 6.7, 6.8, 7, 6.9, 6.8, 6.7, 6.5, 6.3, 6, 5.8]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.15, 0.15, 0.2, 0.2, 0.15, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.35, 0.34, 0.33, 0.32, 0.31, 0.32, 0.33, 0.34, 0.35, 0.36, 0.37, 0.38]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [3.65, 3.66, 3.67, 3.68, 3.69, 3.68, 3.67, 3.66, 3.65, 3.64, 3.63, 3.62]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is maintaining a consistent lateral deviation (d-coordinate) around 0.35 to 0.38 meters, which is within a safe range. The s-speed is mostly positive, indicating forward movement, and the car is not reversing or oscillating significantly. The car is not facing the wall, and there are no crashes or reversals. The car's speed is within the typical range of 5 to 7 m/s, which is consistent with the human's desire to drive on the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is maintaining a consistent s-speed within the typical range of 5 to 7 m/s, which indicates it is driving as expected. The d-coordinate oscillates slightly around the racing line, but the magnitude of oscillation is within the acceptable range (less than 0.3 meters), suggesting the car is not significantly deviating from the racing line. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall, all of which are in line with the human's command to drive on the racing line.
