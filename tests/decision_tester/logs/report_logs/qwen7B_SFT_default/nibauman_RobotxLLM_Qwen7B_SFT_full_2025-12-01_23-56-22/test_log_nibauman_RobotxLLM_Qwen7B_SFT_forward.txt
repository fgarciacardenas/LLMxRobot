Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.

Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates from 0.1 to 0.2 and back to 0.1, which is within the threshold of 0.3 meters for oscillation. The d-speed is below 0.5 m/s, indicating that the oscillation is not significant.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate values are not equal, indicating that the car is not driving on the centerline. The d-coordinate values are 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.0, -0.1, -0.2, which show lateral deviations from the racing line. The human wants the car to drive on the centerline, and the current lateral deviations suggest that the car is not adhering to this command.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 9 samples.

        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.15, 0.05, -0.1, -0.05, 0.2, 0.1, -0.05, 0]

        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is not consistently centered, as it varies between positive and negative values. The car is not maintaining a consistent distance from the centerline, which indicates it is not adhering to the human's request to drive on the centerline.

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate values oscillate around 0.1, indicating that the car is not maintaining a consistent position on the centerline. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, as the car is closer to the right wall in some instances. This suggests that the car is not driving on the centerline as desired.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is fluctuating but remains within a small range, indicating that the car is not significantly deviating from the centerline. The distances to the left and right walls are also relatively equal, suggesting the car is maintaining a central position.
