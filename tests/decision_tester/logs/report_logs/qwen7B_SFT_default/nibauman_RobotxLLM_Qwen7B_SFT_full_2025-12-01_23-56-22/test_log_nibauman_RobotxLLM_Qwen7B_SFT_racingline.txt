        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 5:
The car is reversing if the s-speed is negative or if the s-coordinate is reducing over multiple samples.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is not consistently equal to the distance to the left and right walls, indicating that the car is not driving on the centerline. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, and the car's lateral deviation is fluctuating, which suggests it is not maintaining a central position.

Adhering to Human: False
Sanitized Output: False
Expected Output: True

Test Case: Drive on the centerline
Sample Index: 22
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 14 samples.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) oscillates around 0.1 meters, which is within a reasonable range for maintaining a centerline. The distances to the left and right walls are also approximately equal, indicating that the car is staying on the centerline. 

Adhering to Human: True
