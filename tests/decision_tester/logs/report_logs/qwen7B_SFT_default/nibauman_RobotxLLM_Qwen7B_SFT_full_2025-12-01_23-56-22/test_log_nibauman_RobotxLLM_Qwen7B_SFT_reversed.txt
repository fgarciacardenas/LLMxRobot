Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values, with a magnitude greater than 0.3 meters, indicating oscillation around the racing line. The d-speed is within the negligible range, as it is below 0.5 m/s. The car is reversing, which is not necessary for oscillation, but the oscillation itself is present.
