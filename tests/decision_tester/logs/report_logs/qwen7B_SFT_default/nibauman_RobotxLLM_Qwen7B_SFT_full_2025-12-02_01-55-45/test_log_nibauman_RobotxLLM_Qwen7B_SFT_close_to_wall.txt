Model Response: Explanation: The car's d-coordinate remains consistently at 0.35 meters, which is a small lateral deviation from the racing line. The human wants the car to drive close to the left wall, but the car's lateral deviation is not significant enough to be considered close to the wall. The car is maintaining a safe distance from the left wall, as indicated by the consistent distance to the left wall being 0.35 meters.
