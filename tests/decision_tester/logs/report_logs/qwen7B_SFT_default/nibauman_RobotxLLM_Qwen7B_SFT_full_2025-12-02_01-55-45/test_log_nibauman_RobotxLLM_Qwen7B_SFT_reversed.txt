        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 14 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [25, 24.5, 24, 23.5, 23, 22.5, 22, 21.5, 21, 20.5, 20, 19.5, 19, 18.5]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.2, 0.1, 0.0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1.0, 1.05, 1.1, 1.15, 1.2, 1.25]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.4, 1.35, 1.3, 1.25, 1.2, 1.15, 1.1, 1.05, 1.0, 0.95, 0.9, 0.85, 0.8, 0.75]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: True

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 



    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the centerline. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is reversing along the racing line, as indicated by the negative s-speed values. The d-coordinate oscillates around 0.2, which is not centered on the racing line. The car is not facing the wall, and it has not crashed. However, the car is not driving on the centerline as it should be.

Adhering to Human: False
Sanitized Output: False
Expected Output: True
